<p>I had hoped writing browser-based apps would let me put old phones to productive use, but the effort-to-reward ratio is really bad for my old Windows Phone 8.1 devices. After <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/21/windows-phone-8-1-browser-effectively-a-separate-platform-now/">a short investigation</a>, I will treat WP8.1 as a separate platform with their own (TBD) project focused just on the capability they have. I'm not going to worry about that platform for general-use browser apps like my AS7341 web app. Does this decision also rule out Android phones of similar vintage? I was surprised to learn the answer is "Not Really." It appears Google keeps Chrome updated for Android phones <em>well after </em>they stopped receiving Android updates.</p>

<p>My data point for this investigation was my Nexus 5 phone, which was my personal successor to my Lumia 920 Windows Phone. The hardware is old enough <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/01/20/degraded-nexus-5-battery-demands-immediate-removal/" target="_blank">its battery degraded enough to start puffing up</a>.  That was replaced with a buck converter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/01/22/convert-nexus-5-to-use-external-dc-power/" target="_blank">pretending to be its battery</a> so I could continue using the device. I powered it up to answer the question: how out-of-date is the Chrome browser on this thing? After updating everything available from Google Play store, I tapped on "About Chrome" and was amazed to see version <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/10/chrome-for-android-update_13.html" target="_blank">106.0.5249.126 which was released October 13th 2022</a>.</p>

<p>For context, Nexus 5 launched in 2013 with Android 4. It received next two major Android updates and now runs Android 6, which stopped receiving updates in 2017. Due to this fact I had expected Chrome version to date back to a similar timeframe. Contrary to my expectations, Google continued to update Chrome for Android 6 even though the operating system itself stopped receiving updates, continuing five more years all the way to late 2022. But Chrome 106 was the end of the line, my Nexus 5 could not pick up <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/10/chrome-for-android-update_01090710888.html" target="_blank">107.0.5304.54 released a week and a half later on October 25th, 2022</a>. (Annoyingly, this meant Chrome 106 would display a "Chrome update now available!" prompt even though this phone can't get Chrome 107.)</p>

<p>Looking around for a definitive resource on Chrome support, I found the "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7100626?hl=en" target="_blank">Chrome browser system requirements</a>" page. Today it says the minimum Android version is Android 7, which is consistent with my Android 6 phone being left out. Android 7 received its final system update October 2019 yet is still receiving updates to its Chrome browser. This story of Chrome updates far surpassed my expectations and puts my Nexus 5 phone in a far better position than my Lumia 920 phone. Having a 2022-era browser should mean it can run <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/23/notes-on-as7341-integration-time/">my AS7341 interactive web app</a> with no special treatment at all.</p>

<p>Unknown: Does Apple continue to update Safari for old iOS devices even if they have stopped receiving iOS updates? In a quick web search, I found no information one way or another and I do not have an end-of-life iOS device to check Safari version numbers firsthand.</p>
