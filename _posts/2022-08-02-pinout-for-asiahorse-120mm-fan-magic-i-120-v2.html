<p>The Asiahorse Magic-i 120 V2 bundle included three 120mm cooling fans with integrated addressable RGB LEDs. These fans have a six-wire connector designed to be plugged into a hub that was included in the bundle, along with a remote control to change the light shown performed by those LEDs. Most users just need to plug those fans into the included hub, but some users like myself want to bypass the hub and control each fan directly. For this audience, I present the fan connector pinout derived from <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/08/01/exploring-6-wire-connector-of-asiahorse-magic-i-120-v2/">an exploratory session</a> on my electronics workbench.</p>

<p>Since this was reverse engineered without original design documents, I don't know which side is considered "pin #1" by the engineers who designed this system. These connectors appear to be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jst.com/products/crimp-style-connectors-wire-to-board-type/ph-connector/" target="_blank">JST-PH</a>, whose <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jst.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ePH-new.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet</a> does point to one side as "Circuit #1". But there's no guarantee the engineers followed JST convention. To avoid potential confusion, I'll call them only by name.</p>

<p>Now that I understand its pinout, I will build my own control circuit to replace the default Asiahorse hub.</p>
