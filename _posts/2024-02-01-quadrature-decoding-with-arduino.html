<p>I want to understand the internal workings of a Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet. Right now my focus is on its paper feed motor assembly, and I want to record data reported by a quadrature rotation encoder inside that assembly. I want to track behavior over several seconds, possibly a minute of two, which gets a little unwieldy with a logic analyzer timeline interface. So I thought I should create a tool tailored to my project and I found a promising lead using an <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/01/31/window-shopping-esp32-pulse-counter-pcnt/">ESP32's pulse counter (PCNT) peripheral</a>.</p>

<p>As as I started preparing for the project, thinking through and writing down what I'd need to do, a lot of details felt very familiar in a "wait... I've done this before" way. I had forgotten I've played with quadrature encoders before! A search for "quadrature" on my project notebook (this blog site) found entries on <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/20/reading-faceplate-audio-mode-knob/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading the knob on a Toyota audio head unit</a>, an <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/08/quadrature-encoder-rotary-knob-with-detent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inexpensive knob from Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/27/honda-cd-control-detours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigative detour during Honda audio head unit</a> adventures.</p>

<p>Following my earlier footsteps would be an easier way to go, because the Arduino IDE and <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Stoffregen's quadrature decoder library</a> are already installed on my machine. But this will be the first time I apply it to something turned by a motor instead of by a human hand. Is it fast enough to keep up? Decoder library documentation says 100-127kHz sampling rate is possible on a Teensy 3, which was the library's original target hardware. Running on an ATmega328 would be slower.</p>

<p>Aside: I found <a href="http://gammon.com.au/interrupts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this Gammon forum thread listing technical detail on ATmega328 interrupt service routines</a>, which laid out work just for ISR overhead that would take 5.125us before any ISR code actually runs. This puts a hard upper bound of ~200 kHz on response rate of an ISR that does nothing.</p>

<p>In the spirit of "try the easy thing first" <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/02/02/quadrature-decoding-with-periodic-output/">I'll start with ATmega328 Arduino</a>. If it proves too slow, I have a Teensy LC somewhere, and I definitely have ESP8266 boards. In the unlikely case they all fail to meet my need, I can resume my examination of ESP32's pulse counter (PCNT) peripheral.</p>
