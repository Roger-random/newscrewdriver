<p>After <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/20/philips-sonicare-hx686p-electronics/">looking over the electronics</a> of my retired Philips Sonicare HX686P electric toothbrush, I unsoldered the main circuit board from the actuator, battery, and charging coil so I could remove it from the black plastic chassis.</p>

<p>Separating the main circuit board from the rest of the device also meant I could get good pictures both front and back.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see that there were a handful of surface-mounted components on the back. They couldn't fit everything on one side.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The "pressing too hard" sensor's flexible printed circuit strip is directly soldered to the back of the main board. I see ten soldering points, two per wire except for the left-most where four of them are connected to a single wire. This is consistent with power/ground/clock/data or some similar variation thereof.</p>

<p>On my previous Sonicare HX6530 teardown, my next step was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/18/philips-sonicare-hx6530-actuator/" target="_blank">taking the brush motor actuator apart</a>. It was an instructive process, but a destructive one. Since the actuator in this HX686P is nearly identical, I doubt I'll learn much from taking this one apart. It's also in better shape, as it lacks the rust and deposits of water intrusion. I can keep it intact while hoping a project idea would arise. What would I do with it? I'm not sure! Recently, Hackaday featured somebody <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackaday.com/2023/08/29/its-a-sander-no-its-a-toothbrush-relax-relax-its-both/" target="_blank">turning their old electric toothbrush into a tiny sander</a>. The Hackaday writer Al Williams correctly pointed out this control board has a lot of features unsuitable to sanding. For example each session only runs for two minutes, with a small beep every 30 seconds. If we want to run it as a sander, we might be better off building our own control circuit for the actuator.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sander or not, reusing the actuator will be best done with my own control circuit. I don't know how to do that, but maybe this is a good opportunity to learn! I now have components on hand to support such a learning exploration: circuit boards with existing implementation, a disassembled actuator where I can test the coil by itself, and I have an intact actuator for potential application. And any knowledge I gain could continue to be useful in the future, because I'm still using a Sonicare every evening for my dental hygiene routine and it's just a matter of time before I have additional retired toothbrushes to play with. Toothbrushes, and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/22/fun-with-philips-sonicare-charging-base-hx6100/">their associated charging bases</a>.</p>
