<p>I'm learning to build data apps with Budibase, and I have <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/08/29/choosing-postgresql-as-budibase-external-database/">decided to use PostgreSQL</a> as my database. It should let me do things I can't do with the default database built-in to Budibase. I am not a complete PostgreSQL beginner <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/11/22/notes-on-codecademy-design-databases-with-postgresql/">thanks to a Codecademy course</a> some time ago, but I found that course a bit <em>too </em>beginner-friendly as it didn't go into as much depth as I liked. This time as a refresher I tried <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/index.php">the W3Schools course</a> and didn't finish it, finding it to be too shallow as well. In the quest for something with more meat, I went to the source: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html">PostgreSQL official documentation</a>. The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial.html">tutorial section itself</a> is just about perfect for what I want today, and the remainder of the reference is there when I'm ready for more detail.</p>

<p>I'm running Ubuntu Server in my Budibase VM, and PostgreSQL is available as a part of Ubuntu's application distribution package. For security partitioning purposes, PostgreSQL uses the "<code>postgres</code>" user account instead of the logged-in user and I had trouble logging in with the correct credentials. After a bit of unsuccessful fiddling, I tried an alternative approach of running <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/">PostgreSQL as a Docker container</a>. Now I can log in by specifying <code>-u postgres</code> at the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/exec/"><code>docker exec</code></a> command line.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Once logged in, I verified the Docker image included two tools that would greatly help with my experiments. I had thought I would need to write similar tools myself via PostgreSQL API but reading PostgreSQL tutorial I learned they already existed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>, a text command-line interface to PostgreSQL. It allows me to experiment and iterate through my queries at a low level before I try to make them fancy and easy to use with Budibase. The second tool is <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html"><code>pg_dump</code></a>, which backs up my database data in plain text format. The text file is a list of <code>psql</code> commands to recreate my database. I always have the fear that I would accidentally make a hugely destructive change to my database and <em>not even realize it</em> until much later. Now I can periodically take snapshot backups with <code>pg_dump</code> so I can recover from such mistakes. And more than that, I can check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">text file diff</a> between these snapshots. I can't always mentally parse every line of difference but I can rest assured scope of my changes were not more drastic than I had intended as <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/08/31/budibase-with-postgresql/">I work with my data</a>.</p>
