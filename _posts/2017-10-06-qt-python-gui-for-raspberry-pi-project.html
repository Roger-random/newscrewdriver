<p>Since the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/">mission of the Raspberry Pi foundation</a> is to "<em>put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world</em>" there is no shortage of options for programming the Pi. We have at our disposal many choices in programming languages, each with multiple application frameworks, and a large community of Raspberry Pi users for support.</p>

The ROS plug-in architecture for operator GUI is <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rqt">rqt</a>, based on <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</a>. And like much of ROS, the user has the option of working with rqt in either C++ or <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Python%20Plugin">Python</a>. Since I had started dabbling with ROS in Python before getting distracted, I thought the combination of Qt and Python would be a good direction to go.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9999" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/python-logo.png?w=600" alt="Python Logo" width="300" height="95"></p>
<p>The Qt framework itself is aimed at C++ developers, and its <a href="http://doc.qt.io/">documentation</a> is written accordingly. Fortunately there are translation layers (language bindings) for Python. The one that seems to be the most mature is <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt">PyQt</a> with a long list of resources, books, and online tutorials.</p>
<p>The next decision to make is which version to start learning. Browsing through the resources, it looks like Qt 4 is the mainstream version and Qt 5 is the new shiny. Since ROS is still in the midst of transitioning from Python 2 to Python 3, I assume rqt would be relatively old school as well. No matter which one I choose, there'll be differences I have to tackle whenever I get around to diving deep into ROS. On the assumption that the latest and greatest versions are also the most polished (an assumption based on how Python 3 cleaned up a lot of architectural messiness of Python 2) I thought I'd start learning with the latest releases and make adjustments later as I need to.</p>
<p>So: Qt 5 and Python 3 it is, with the help of <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/">PyQt5</a> binding. Which is easily installed on a Raspbian Stretch system by installing the packages "pyqt5-dev" and "pyqt5-dev-tools".</p>
