This is not itself a bad thing: it let me see that Rails has a large surface area of machinery, pre-built components that can be put to work quickly.</p>
<p>But the majority of the course is of the "type this and look at the results" without much explanation of what I just typed and why. Example: After writing a few lines of Ruby code, the student is instructed to go into the command prompt and type "rake db:migrate" followed by "rake db:seed" before instructed to marvel at the result of the magic.</p>
<p>What did that do? The class didn't really say beyond "made database". Afterwards I went back and dig into the documentation to come up with a guess at what's going on:</p>
<p>The lines of code turned out to be a way to define schema for a database table. After the schema is updated, the table itself is <strong>migrate</strong>d from the previous schema to the new schema. In this case there is no existing table, so 'migrate' creates a new empty one. Then "db:seed" inserts some information pre-generated by the Codecademy course author into the just-created database so it is not empty.</p>
<p>And "rake", which I had inferred to be some kind of database tool, is actually a general task running tool like "make" for C. I got the wrong impression since all I saw were database tasks.</p>
<p>That's one example, there were many others. With this lack of explanation I'm sure I have quite a few misconceived notions on how Rails apps are built. Heck, what I described above with 'db:migrate' etc. might be wrong! I'll learn my errors in due course.</p>
<p>If it was titled "Interactive demo of Ruby on Rails" I would be satisfied with what I got, but I don't think it deserves the title "Learn Ruby on Rails" when actual learning has been left as an exercise for the student.</body></html></p>
