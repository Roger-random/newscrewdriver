<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-gets-boost-private-sector-startups">Science News article online</a> experimented with interactivity not possible in their print edition. It was fairly simple at first glance: when a cursor hovers over certain places in the image, additional information pops up. Seen all over the web, like the little pieces of trivia behind <a href="http://www.bing.com/">bing.com</a> background picture of the day.</p>
<p>What caught my attention is the link in the corner: "<a href="https://www.thinglink.com/?buttonSource=badgeButtonBox">Made with ThingLink, Learn More</a>" What I had thought was a simple piece of HTML is actually a business built around the concept.</p>
<p>A brief exploration found that ThingLink hosts the image (and associated server storage and bandwidth) plus the interactive scripting. The package of content is then available to be served alongside content hosted elsewhere, such as <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/help/WordPress">WordPress.com</a>. I can embed a ThingLink right here in this post, if I had something interesting to show.</p>
<p>There's a basic level of the service for free. To make money, they sell higher tiers with features like customization, branding, and analytic information. I'm ignorant on how this information might be valuable, but ThingLink has an idea: they believe the full set of features is worth over $200/month to some people.</p>
<p>So definitely not just a trivial piece of HTML. It is the tip of the iceberg of a corner of web commerce I didn't even know existed before today.</p>
