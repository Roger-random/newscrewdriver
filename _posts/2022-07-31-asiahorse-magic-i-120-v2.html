<p>I wanted to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/30/shopping-for-pc-cooling-fans-with-rgb-led/">play with a set of PC case cooling fans with embedded addressable RGB LEDs</a>, with the intent of learning how to control them for a future project. For extra challenge, I got a multipack that combined both fan and LED controls into a single (probably proprietary) connector that plugged into a bundled hub. Using the selection criteria of "Lowest bidder of the day" I bought a three-pack of fans: the Asiahorse Magic-i 120 V2 and I look forward to seeing how it works.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before I start cutting things up, I need to verify the product worked as originally designed. I won't need a computer for this as this multipack came with a remote control for the hub that allows operation without a computer. This lets me explore its signals without the risk of damaging a computer. I just need to supply power in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pinoutguide.com/Power/BigPower_pinout.shtml" target="_blank">4-pin accessory format</a> popular with pre-SATA hard drives and optical disks. I didn't need a computer here, either, as I had an AC adapter with this plug that originally came in a kit that turned internal HDDs into USB HDDs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There were no instructions in the box, but things were straightforward. Three fans plugged into the hub, and a power cable connected my AC adapter to the hub. As soon as I turned on the power, all three fans started spinning. The LED light show didn't start until I pressed the "On" button on the remote.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>RGB LEDs in this fan are mounted in the hub, on the outside perimeter of the motor control board. I count 12 LEDs and they aimed along motor axis upwards into the center portion of translucent fan blades. These colorful lights are then diffused along length of the blade, resulting in a colorful spinning disk. While shopping on Newegg I saw other arrangements. Some fans have LEDs around the outside perimeter instead, and some fans illuminate both the hub and the perimeter. Each manufacturer hoping to capture the attention of a buyer with novelty of their aesthetic.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This remote control allowed me to cycle between various colorful programs or choose from a set of solid colors. I had hoped the colorful programs would ripple across the fans, but all three fans appear to display identical light sequence. I could control LED brightness or turn all the lights off, but I didn't seem to have any control over fan speed. I guess this is where an instruction manual would have been useful.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>If I wanted to build something bright and colorful that circulates air, almost everything is already here and ready to go. I just have to wire up a power switch to turn everything on/off, and the remote can take care of the rest. But I didn't buy this just to have some lights. I wanted full control and I'm not afraid to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/08/01/exploring-6-wire-connector-of-asiahorse-magic-i-120-v2/">start cutting things up to get there</a>.</p>
