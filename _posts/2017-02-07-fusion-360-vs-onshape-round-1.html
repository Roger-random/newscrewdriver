<img class=" size-full wp-image-4000 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fusion-360-logo31.png" alt="fusion-360-logo31" width="125" height="193">Since completing the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/product-design-fusion-360">Udemy overview of Autodesk Fusion 360</a> a few days ago, I've started working on a project to get hands-on experience. Here are the items which made the strongest impressions after my first few days:</p>
<h2>Advantage: Autodesk Fusion 360</h2>
<p><strong>UI Responsiveness</strong>: As an application executing locally, it is vastly more responsive to my actions than Onshape executing across the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Assembly</strong>: In Onshape, parts are created in Parts Studios tabs and put together in a separate Assembly tabs. Parts need to have designated "mate connector" added to their designs before the assembly can occur. I never got the hang of this system. In contrast, every Design window in Fusion 360 can import parts from other designs without special entities like mate connectors.</p>
<h2>Advantage: Onshape</h2>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong> Onshape is really good about informing the user of constraints. Sketch entities are blue when they are under-constrained. When they are properly constrained, they turn black. When they are over-constrained, the conflicting constraints are <strong><em>all</em> </strong>highlighted in red.</p>
<p>In contrast, Fusion 360 makes no distinction between under and properly constrained. My only indication an entity was under-constrained is long after the fact, when it would move unexpectedly in response to a change elsewhere. When over-constrained, a dialog box tells you the latest action causes over-constraining, but it doesn't show you the conflicts so you'd have to go hunting for conflicting constraints yourself. This is a lot of lost time and a huge drain on productivity.</p>
<p>After a week of Fusion 360, this is the Onshape feature I miss the most.</p>
<p><strong>UI scaling</strong>: Browser makers have lots of practice dealing with variable sized content on variable sized screens. Running Onshape in a browser window at 4K resolution was painless. In contrast, Fusion 360 scales poorly on a 4K screen, leaving many UI elements tiny and difficult to use.</p>
<h2>Other Notes:</h2>
<p><strong>Sharing:</strong> Onshape free tier users are not allowed private documents, so every file is automatically shared with the world. Fusion 360 was designed for a world with designers and customers and clients, so it has a bunch of tools to manage access and permissions. In all that complication, they seemed to have forgotten to include a simple "share with the whole world" option.</p>
<p><strong>Updates:</strong> Both of them update frequently. While it is easier to pick up an update in Onshape (refresh the browser) the Fusion 360 auto-update has been fairly seamless so far.</body></html></p>
