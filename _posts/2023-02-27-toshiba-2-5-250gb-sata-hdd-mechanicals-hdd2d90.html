<p>A few days ago, I thought I've learned enough electronics to get something out of examining circuit boards in consumer electronics. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/26/toshiba-2-5-250gb-sata-hdd-control-board-hdd2d90/">Striking out on this Toshiba 2.5" hard drive control board</a> immediately after <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/24/hard-drive-wd800-control-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming up empty on a Western Digital 3.5" hard drive control board</a> makes me think I've overreached too far beyond my skills. No matter, I'm still skilled with a screwdriver and can handle taking apart mechanical components.</p>

<p>After removing those screws, the lid came off easily.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find two platters was packed in this drive less than a centimeter thick representative impressive miniaturization at work. One difference between a desktop drive and this laptop drive is the read-write heads are physically pulled off the platter in parked position. I was under the impression HDD read-write heads are far too fragile for transition a gap between mechanical pieces or rubbing against anything other than a cushion of air. Seeing this tells me they're not as fragile as I had thought, but I don't know what the actual engineering constraints involved.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/toshiba-hdd2d90-rw-head-latch.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-35422"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the opposite end of the pivot, beyond the voice coil actuator, is this mechanism whose purpose I don't fully understand. The pivoting metal arm could slot into a sharp hook next to the voice coil, keeping the read-write head away from the platter. But how does it know when to engage or not? It works in conjunction with the white plastic part, but I couldn't figure out how the whole mechanism works together. My best guess is that we have a clever mechanism that would lock the pivot safely in place until the voice coil actuated pivot performs effectively a "secret knock." Taking advantage of inertia and momentum, the right sequence of motion would release the lock. To verify this hypothesis, I would need to reassemble the drive and see if I can power it up, but by the time I thought of doing so, I had already passed the point of no return.</p>

<p>Because with the mystery latch removed, it was easy to remove the read-write head assembly and once I did, I could not put it back into place.</p>

<p>Flipping it over, I see a hex nut holding the entire stack together.</p>

<p>Loosening and removing the nut allowed disassembly of the entire stack.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find both platters were held by a single screw. Platters for large desktop drives always had multiple fasteners to ensure their platters could not rotate out of place. With a single screw, we don't have that mechanical guarantee. I guess it's just friction preventing these platters from rotating relative to each other or the spindle.</p>

<p>I was pretty impressed at how thin and compact this laptop hard drive was, but hard drive engineers <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/28/western-digital-sff-8784-hybrid-hdd-ssd-teardown-wd5000m21k/">have done even better than this</a>.</p>
