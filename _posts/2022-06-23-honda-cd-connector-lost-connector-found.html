<p>Examining the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/22/honda-accord-hvac-knobs-electrical/">fan speed and temperature adjustment knobs</a> from a Honda Accord HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) control board taught me the existence of rotary encoders that could convey a position from a set of positions within a range of rotation. This was an alternative to potentiometers I had not been aware of, a lesson on top of everything else I learned playing with this module. But all this exploration also meant handling the assembly a lot, eventually breaking something.</p>

<p>This board attached to the main control board via a flexible cable that could only flex so many times before it broke from fatigue. Fortunately, these buttons and lights were associated with HVAC controls, and I hadn't planned to go figure out that half of the board anyway. And even if these buttons were associated with the CD player, I had no luck so far reading button presses either. Either way, no big loss, and I dropped it in my pile of electronic circuit boards.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>When I did so, a shape in the pile caught my eye. A week ago, it was just another electrical connector on a unmarked circuit board I forgot details about. But I now recognize it as the edge connector matching one on the CD/HVAC control board I've been exploring. Which meant this circuit board used to be the CD player mainboard that sat behind the dashboard.</p>

<p>Almost as valuable as the connector itself are silkscreened information on the circuit board, labeling the pins. I had puzzled out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/17/preliminary-pinout-for-honda-cd/" target="_blank">a preliminary subset</a> just from poking around with a multimeter, but now I have the answer key. I was happy to find confirmation for my guesses and filling in unknowns. Earlier I was puzzled by the hint that multiple pins might be ground, and now I can see there are indeed three pins (7, 8, and 9) all connected to ground. I had traced out a dedicated pin for the power button (24), but I had missed the adjacent one was for eject (23). Things along those lines.</p>

<p>I hadn't put any effort into figuring out the illumination pins, because I didn't want to risk making a mistake that would send +14.4V into the wrong place and burning things up. But now that I see lamp pins clearly labeled, I want to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/24/honda-cd-panel-lights-and-lcd-backlight/">light them up</a>.</p>
