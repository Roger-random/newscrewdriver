<p>Once I had an <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/15/and-i-ended-up-with-tape/">old webcam taped to the carriage of a retired 3D printer</a>, I shifted focus to writing code to coordinate the electronic and mechanical bits. My <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/26/simple-logger-extended-with-subset-list/">most recent experiments in application development</a> were in the Microsoft UWP platform, so I'm going to continue that momentum until I find a good reason to switch to something else.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Microsoft's development documentation site quickly pointed me to an example that implements <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/simple-camera-preview-access" target="_blank">a simple camera preview control</a>. It looks like the intent here is to put up a low resolution preview so the user can frame the camera prior to taking a high resolution still image. This should suffice as a starting point.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In order to gain access to the camera feed, my application must declare the webcam capability. This will show the user a dialog box that the application wants to access the camera with options to approve or deny, and the user must approve before I could get video. Confusingly, that was not enough. If I approve camera access I still see errors. It turns out that even though I didn't care about audio, I had to request access for the microphone as well. This seems like a bug but a simple enough workaround in the short term.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once that was in place, I got a low resolution video feed from the camera. I don't see any way to adjust parameters of this live video. I would like to shift to a higher resolution and I'm willing to accept lower frame rate. I would also like to reduce noise and I'm willing to accept lower brightness. The closest thing I found to camera options is something called "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/camera-profiles" target="_blank">camera profiles</a>". For the moment this is a moot point because when I queried for profiles on this camera, <code>IsVideoProfileSupported</code> returned false.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I imagine there is another code path to obtain video feed, used by video conference applications and video recording apps. There must be a way to select different resolutions and adjust other parameters, but I have a basic feed now so I'm content to put that on the TO-DO list and move on.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The next desire is ability to select a different camera, since laptops usually have a built-in camera and I would attach another via USB. Thanks to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49312099/how-to-display-2-web-camera-preview-in-uwp" target="_blank">this thread on Stack Overflow</a>, I found a way to do so by setting <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.mediacaptureinitializationsettings.videodeviceid" target="_blank"><code>VideoDeviceId</code></a><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.mediacaptureinitializationsettings.videodeviceid"> property</a> of <code>MediaCaptureInitializationSettings</code>. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And yay, I have a video feed! Now I want to move the 3D printer carriage by pressing the arrow keys. I created keyboard event handlers <code>KeyDown </code>and <code>KeyUp</code> for my application, but the handlers were never called. My effort to understand this problem became the entry point for a deep rabbit hole into the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/17/reviewing-uwp-keyboard-routed-events/">world of keyboard events in UWP</a>.</p>
