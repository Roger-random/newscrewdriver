<p>I got this retired laptop <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/22/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-up-and-running/">up and running</a>, but it felt sluggish and I thought I should try upgrading the SATA hybrid drive to a full SSD, which meant it was time to bring out the screwdriver set and dig in. When the tablet module is removed from its docking base, we can see four circles for the screws holding the tablet together. Unfastening those four screws allowed me to travel around the perimeter to pop clips loose all around the shell, allowing me to extract the heart of the machine. Flipping it face down, we see the hard drive is in the center flanked by battery modules on either side.</p>

<p>Quite a few black adhesive-backed sheets help keep things from rattling loose. I had to peel several back to access the drive, which was itself in a foil package that I couldn't figure out how to remove without damage. I ended up tearing the whole foil off to expose the hard drive and its data connector. I immediately realized I had a problem.</p>

<p>I've never seen this kind of drive connector before. This machine's spec sheet called it a SATA drive, but it is apparently not the same kind of SATA drive I've dealt with to date. Certainly the SATA SSD I had planned to install into this machine would not fit, seeing how it has an entirely different (and much larger) connector.</p>

<p>Removing the original drive, its label identifies itself as a WD Black Solid State Hybrid Drive. 500 GB capacity with 8GB NAND Model WD5000M21K. A search indicates this connector <a href="https://amzn.to/39ulWLJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is called SFF-8784</a>. (*) <a href="https://amzn.to/38pRClp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adapters are available</a> (*) to put one of these drives in a SATA slot type I'm familiar with, which looks to be only possible because of its compact dimensions. And because of those dimensions, the reverse is not possible: we can't put the popular form factor SATA drive into a space designed for SFF-8784. However, <a href="https://amzn.to/2uEF22Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there exist adapters</a> (*) to put a mSATA drive into such a location, or <a href="https://amzn.to/2Spbks6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adaptor for a M.2 form factor SATA drive</a> (*).</p>

<p>I own a few M.2 SATA SSDs, but they are currently in active use. When I retire one it might be interesting to get a M.2 adapter to put in this machine. I'll wait until that happens, or until an interesting project arises, before buying anything. [UPDATE: A M.2 SATA SSD became available for experimentation, and I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/10/ssd-upgrade-project-delayed-by-shipping-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an adapter (actually two) to perform the upgrade</a>.]</p>

<p>I have to abandon the SATA SSD upgrade project for now, but since I already have the shell open, I'm going to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/24/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-tablet-innards/">look around just for curiosity's sake</a>.</p>
