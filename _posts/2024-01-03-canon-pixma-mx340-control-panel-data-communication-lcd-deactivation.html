<p>I've been examining the internal communication of a Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet, between its main board and its control panel. After examining what happens <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/01/02/canon-pixma-mx340-control-panel-data-communication-stand-by/">when the system goes into standby</a>, I have one more trace from my initial batch of captures: a relatively simple "screen saver" mode.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the system is brought out of stand by and turned on, it will wait for the user to do something. If no user actions are taken, a few things happen. After just a few seconds of inactivity, it does something mechanical with the print carriage. It's on my to-do list to better understand that later. A few minutes after that, the LCD screen goes blank. This is different from a full system standby, because the rest of the printer remains powered on. (The power LED and WiFi LEDs are still glowing, for example.) I wanted to catch this transition and see if there are any similarities to the full standby sequence.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When the LCD went blank, my logic analyzer captured a single two-byte sequence 0x04 0x75. This was very short! And very good news, because that left no ambiguity. 0x04 0x75 was indeed part of the system standby sequence, and now I have definitive proof it is a "go to sleep" command.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With the screen deactivated, I pressed a button and saw the button matrix reporting value change. Approximately 40ms after the report with new value, I saw 0x04 0xF5. 4.5ms after that, I see the LCD screen update data burst pattern. Looks like 0x04 0xF5 is a "wake up" command. Going back to review the system power-up sequence, I see 0x04 0xF5 was sent <em>after </em>the first LCD screen update pattern. At first I was disappointed because it contradicted the "wake up" observation, but then I remembered the first LCD screen update only lasted about 100ms before the second burst of screen data. Too short to represent data expected to be seen by the user. I had hypothesized that first update cleared the screen and this observation actually supports rather than contradicts the hypothesis: it makes sense for the system to send data to clear the screen, <em>then </em>wake up the screen for display. Ensuring the user is never presented with a screen filled with random uninitialized bits in memory.</p>

<p>It's still tentative and a tiny fraction of all the commands streaming across this channel, but I'm pretty happy I managed to decipher this much. It exceeded my expectation when I started this teardown project. I'm learning as I go! The next step will be to figure out what tools will help me gain further insight into this data, and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/01/04/window-shopping-custom-saleae-high-level-analyzer-extension/">I don't think a custom Saleae Logic extension will help here</a>.</p>
