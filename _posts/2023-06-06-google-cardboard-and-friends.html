<p>Almost ten years ago, an Oculus Rift DK2 (Development Kit 2) <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/05/my-virtual-reality-a-ha-moment/">gave me an exciting peek into consumer-grade virtual reality</a>. I was enthusiastic, but the leading edge of VR technology was still very raw and also very expensive. Trying to make this novel technology more accessible, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard">Google Cardboard</a> was a way to turn Android phones into VR headsets. A simple box so cheap, they can be given away as promotions. I have a BB-8 themed viewer that promoted <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>.</p>

<p>The downside of using a phone is that we only have an accelerometer to sense device <em>orientation</em>. There's nothing to sense device <em>position</em>. This meant visuals can rotate in response to a head tilt in roll/pitch/yaw directions (three degrees of freedom or 3DOF) but doesn't change if we take a step left/right, or a step front/back, or sit/stand/kneel. (Which constitute an additional three degrees of freedom for a total of six or 6DOF.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I eventually decided trading off three degrees of freedom for low cost was false economy. My virtual reality "Ah-ha" moment of leaning in close to a panel was impossible to do in a 3DOF system like Google Cardboard. It's not just a matter of missing features: I quickly get motion sickness in 3DOF VR. No matter how I tried to keep my body still, there are small movements in the remaining three degrees of freedom and after a few minutes my body started protesting the lack of visual feedback for that motion.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Still, the price was low, which translated to high distribution volume. People tried to iterate on the idea to grow the market, and I kept hoping I could find something I like. Spending money that I should have saved towards a real 6DOF VR system.</p>

<p>The most entertaining take was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-Master#2015%E2%80%932019:_Virtual_reality">a VR revival of the View-Master brand</a>. I had an old-school View-Master with a few picture discs, and that nostalgia motivated me to buy one of these new viewers. Technologically speaking it was merely Google Cardboard in View-Master's signature red plastic, including the orange "lever". As it was merely a styling and software effort, the business case failed: VR content cost a lot more to produce than those old View-Master picture discs! The best thing I can say is the fact View-Master experiences were only good for short durations, avoiding my motion sickness issue.</p>

<p>With big brands like Mattel and Google onboard, a lot of other brands jumped into the market looking for a successful niche. This was a "Utopia 360" viewer that added two axes of adjustments to improve visual comfort: (1) focal distance between our eyes and the phone, and (2) IPD adjustment. (Interpupillary Distance, or the distance between eyeballs.) Instead of standard tap-on-screen interface, this viewer bundled a small Bluetooth controller. Unfortunately, these features needed software-side support to be useful, and approximately nobody bothered to do so. (This particular unit had a troublesome spring-loaded generic phone holder, so I decided to make a custom holder as <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2016/10/09/nexus-5x-in-utopia-360-google-cardboard-vr/">one of my first 3D printing projects</a>.)</p>

<p>Samsung is never shy about throwing money at experimental niches. They took a stab with the Gear VR. Going beyond standard Google Cardboard, Samsung added a directional keypad to the side as well as higher quality accelerometer for faster and more accurate 3DOF feedback. I didn't have a Samsung phone but had a friend who had a Galaxy S7. I thought he shared my enthusiasm of VR, but I later learned he was just being polite while I spewed my enthusiasm. How did I learn this? I bought this Gear VR for him to use with his phone. Years later, he retired that S7 and donated it to my pile of retired Android phones I keep <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/31/array-of-android-magnetometers/">for random projects</a>. Along with the phone he also returned the Gear VR, still unopened in its packaging. By then Samsung has moved on to other things and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Gear_VR#End_of_Samsung_support">shut down their Gear VR software support ecosystem</a> so now I can't do anything with it either.</p>

<p>My final 3DOF VR experiment was this first-generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Daydream">Google Daydream</a> viewer. It was a small additional expenditure as I already had a Google Pixel phone to go with it. Daydream was Google's own evolution of the Cardboard concept, with at least two advancements: there were two capacitive touch nubs on the headset to help the phone align its onscreen image. A handheld remote was included, much like the Utopia 360. Google used their muscle to get more software support for Daydream controllers than Utopia 360 ever got for theirs, but there was no way to overcome the fundamental limitations of 3DOF VR.</p>

<p>This string of experiments firmed up my position on virtual reality: 6DOF or GTFO. By the time Oculus released their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Go">Go headset</a>, I dismissed it as just another 3DOF system with no meaningful advantages over my Google Daydream. I decided against buying a Go, saving up money towards <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/07/ditching-phone-based-virtual-reality-for-pc/">a 6DOF system of my own</a>.</p>
