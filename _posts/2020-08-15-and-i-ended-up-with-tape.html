<p>Now I feel ridiculous. After spending time <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/13/hp-webcam-hd-4310-teardown/">disassembling a HP HD 4310 webcam</a> to see how to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/14/mild-hp-hd-4310-webcam-integration-modification/">best modify it for mounting</a> on the carriage of my retired 3D printer chassis... I realized the fastest and easiest way to test some ideas is to just tape the thing to the carriage with good old reliable blue painter's tape.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The tape would not be sturdy enough for precision measurements, of course, but that's not important on the first pass through. I needed to see if the camera can autofocus within the range I want, and I need to see the quality of images I can get with this camera. And most of all, I need to verify I could write the code necessary to control everything working together as a unit. None of that need a rigid mounting.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Right now the biggest problem is the USB cable exerting a force as the carriage moves around. It is a pretty soft cable, but strong enough to wiggle a taped-down camera. I suspect any kind of 3D printed bracket would be enough to resist the force exerted by the USB cable.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the short term, this is not a huge problem. Tape on the left and right sides of the camera has good leverage to resist the cable as the carriage moves along the X axis, and Y-axis movements would not exert any force at all since it is an independent assembly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>So a little blue tape is all I need right now to let me <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/16/webcam-test-with-uwp/">get started on the coding</a>.</p>
