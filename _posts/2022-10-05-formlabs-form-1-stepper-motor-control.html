<p>I have a broken FormLabs Form 1+ laser resin 3D printer and I've been figuring out how to operate subcomponents for potential repurposing in the future. I just got <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/10/04/formlabs-form-1-laser-control-circuit-partial/">a basic (if imprecise and incomplete) understanding</a> of how to operate its 64mW 405nm laser, which I considered the most challenging component. Now that's done, I'll wrap up my Form 1+ exploration by looking at what I considered the least challenging component: its two stepper motors.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The larger of these motors operate the Z-axis, the smaller one operates the resin tilt tray. Both of those have four-wire connector to the printer mainboard, with pins labeled A+/A-/B+/B-. This identifies them as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor#Bipolar_motors" target="_blank">bipolar stepper motors</a> popular in the field of FDM 3D printers and thus quite familiar to me. In order to repurpose these motors elsewhere, I just need to know two parameters: their operating voltage and current limits.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To determine these values, I started by finding the existing stepper motor driver chip which was placed close to the two stepper motor connectors. It is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ti.com/product/DRV8821" target="_blank">Texas Instruments DRV8821</a> dual stepper motor driver chip. The chip itself is capable of handling up to 32V and 1.5A but configured for lower values for use in this printer.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Voltage was easier to determine, as I looked up position of motor voltage (VM) pins on the chip and probe them while the printer is active. They measured 24V DC. Finding the current limit took a bit more work. DRV8821 datasheet section <em>7.3.2 Current Regulation</em> gave the formula: (Current Limit) = (Reference Voltage) / (5 * Current Sensing Resistor). There are four current sensing resistors wired on the circuit board, so I had to figure out which motor is wired to which pins on the driver. Probing for continuity, I found the following:</p>

<p>This tells me the current sensing resistors AISEN (DRV8821 pin 4) and BISEN (47) are associated with the Z-axis motor. Both are labeled R100 which I decoded to mean 0.1 Ohm. CISEN (26) and DISEN (21) are then for tilt motor which are labeled R200, for 0.2 Ohm. Probing the circuit while powered-up, I found the voltage dividing resistors supplying reference voltages and measured it at 0.5V for both ABVREF (17) and CDVREF (18).</p>

<p>Using DRV8821 datasheet formula, I calculate the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Z-axis stepper motor can be driven with 24V DC at a maximum of 0.5/(5*0.1) = 1A.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Tilt stepper motor can be driven with 24V DC at a maximum of 0.5/(5*0.2) = 0.5A.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
