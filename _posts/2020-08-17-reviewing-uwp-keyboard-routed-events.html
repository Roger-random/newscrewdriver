<p>I wanted to have keyboard control of the 3D printer carriage, moving <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/16/webcam-test-with-uwp/">the webcam view</a> by pressing arrow keys. I knew enough about the application framework to know I needed to implement handlers for the <code>KeyDown </code>and <code>KeyUp</code> events, but in my first implementation those handlers are never called.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If at first I don't succeed, it's time to go to the manual.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first stop is the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overview for UWP Events and Routed Events</a>, the umbrella of event processing architecture including keyboard events. It was an useful review and I was glad I hadn't forgotten anything fundamental or have missed anything significantly new.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next stop was the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/keyboard-interactions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UI design document for keyboard interactions</a>. Again this was technically a review, but I've forgotten much of this information. Keyboard handling is complicated! It's not just an array of buttons, there are a lot of interactions between keys and conventions build up over decades as to what computer literate users have come to expect.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When I think of key interactions, my first reaction is to think about the shift key and control key. These modifier keys change the meaning of another button: the difference between lowercase 'c', uppercase 'C' and Control+C which might be anything from "interrupt command line program" to "Copy to clipboard."</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But that's not important to my current project. My desire to move the camera carriage using arrow keys opened up an entirely different can of worms: <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/18/learning-uwp-keyboard-navigation/">keyboard navigation</a>.</p>
