<img class=" size-full wp-image-13341 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/qtlogo.png" alt="QtLogo" width="87" height="70">Once I decided to learn how to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> application using the <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/">PyQt5</a>Â <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> binding for the <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</a> framework, I looked online for some resources to get started. The reference guides for <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/">PyQt5</a> and <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/">Qt version 5</a> itself seems to be fairly robust, but I needed a little push to get over the initial learning curve to understand where to look for what I need.</p>
<p>The Python Foundation's <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt/Tutorials">wiki for PyQt tutorials</a> has a fairly long list. But when I looked, only one explicitly states it is for PyQt5. So off I go to <a href="http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/">Zetcode's PyQt5 Tutorial</a>. It was a very bare-bones tutorial that might be a bit too bare for a complete beginner trying to learn GUI programming. But for somebody who already knows the general concepts of a windowing graphics interface system, it is a quick primer to learn the vocabulary.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9999" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/python-logo.png?w=600" alt="Python Logo" width="300" height="95"></p>
<p>Since I've worked with various flavors of Windows frameworks (from raw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">Win32</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library">MFC</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a>) I just needed a tutorial to help me connect concepts in my head to the terminology used in Qt. For example: in Qt, when something happens, a notification called a "signal" occurs. A signal can be connected to a "slot" which can then respond to whatever just happened. Once I learned this, I was able to translate the concepts into my head: a "signal" is an event that could be raised, and a "slot" is an event handler. Once I got this and a few other basic "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>" translations in my head I could switch to the reference documentation to find answers.</p>
<p>One important note: Even though it is labelled as a PyQt5 tutorial, Zetcode's tutorial is actually pretty much the <a href="http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt4/">PyQt4</a> tutorial updated with the changes to syntax needed for PyQt5. It doesn't actually cover anything <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt5-intro.html">that is new in Qt5</a>. For me this is fine, because the "old way" covered in the tutorial is probably what I'll end up using when I go even further back in time for the ROS flavor of Qt.</p>
<p>But know there's no coverage of the Qt5 advancements in declarative interface construction, hardware-accelerated rendering, etc. Anybody who wants to learn the new toys of Qt 5 would have to look elsewhere.</body></html></p>
