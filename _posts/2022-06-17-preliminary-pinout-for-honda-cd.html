<p>I have a Honda in-dash CD (and HVAC) control board and I want to see if I can make its LCD work. After I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/16/soldering-practice-with-honda-cd-lcd-driver/">melted through conformal coating</a> over the Sanyo LC75883 LCD driver chip, I was able to get an electrical connection with my meter so I can test for continuity between the pins (that are too fine for me to solder) to something I can more easily work with. I quickly found that much of the CD player functionality is connected to a small black rectangular connector I noticed earlier. Not just the LCD driver chip's data communication lines, but also the big central rotary knob and button.</p>

<p>There is a large degree of uncertainty here, because I didn't find what all of the pins did. I also found two pins that both appear to be ground, and I don't know if there's an important distinction between those two pins. This incomplete understanding explains the problems I will encounter later.</p>

<p>Using the numbers on the circuit board silkscreen, the pins are 1 to 24 from right to left. (Silkscreen shows  1 in the upper right, 2 in the lower right, 23 in the upper left, and 24 in the lower left.)</p>

<p>Once these connections were made, I could make further progress. That is, running into an <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/18/honda-cd-lcd-driver-problems/">entirely different set of headaches</a>.</p>
