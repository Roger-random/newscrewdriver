<p>The first step of documenting my experience on WordPress is... talking about WordPress itself. Self-referential, yes, but it actually served as a great introduction into a different mindset: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">Software as a Service (SaaS)</a>.</p>
<p>WordPress is itself a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management system</a> designed to run entirely over the web. Not only is the content stored on a remote server, the management UI (like the text editor I'm typing this in) is served by the WordPress service over the web. There is no application to install on my computer. When I want to work on my WordPress site, I use my web browser.</p>
<p>SaaS is gradually taking over a lot of the software world, and as a Windows developer, I've been missing a lot of the action. It's time to get to know this new cloud-based world. A world where the service is available anywhere there's a web browser, because a browser is all the client software you'd ever need.</p>
<p>Or... is it?</p>
<p>It turns out the client-side software concept is not dead, not quite. And not even at WordPress. While it was no surprise to learn that WordPress have <a href="https://apps.wordpress.org">mobile apps</a> to access the service on iOS and Android, I was greatly amused to learn they have also introduced <a href="https://desktop.wordpress.com/?ref=promo_write_a0001">desktop client software</a> for Linux, MacOS, and.... Windows.</p>
<p>Yep, Windows client software.</p>
<p>What is old is new again.</p>
