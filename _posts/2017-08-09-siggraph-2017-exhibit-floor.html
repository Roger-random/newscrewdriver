<p>And finally, a few words about the exhibit floor of SIGGRAPH 2017. After all, it is primarily what my exhibits-only pass is intended for. My first stop was a quick glance over the paper posters. It is interesting to see where researchers are focused today. Some of them are solving problems I didn't even know were problems.</p>
<p>There were the mega-booths expected of a tech trade show, by the usual suspects. Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA were all present to proclaim each of them are the best for graphics. This year AMD has a pretty compelling story with their Ryzen CPUs and Vega GPUs and I wish the best for the underdog.</p>
<p>There were also many large booths offering VR experiences. Not the small consumer grade VR experiences like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive with two or three tracking devices. These are huge setups with tens of cameras offering freedom of movement over hundreds of square feet. I was impressed at all the technology and investment going into VR until I got a little smarter: They are actually motion capture companies that have configured their demonstration booths to show VR experiences because that's what's hot this year for getting people's attention. Most of their revenue come from doing things other than virtual reality.</p>
<p>For trade show exhibits that are presumably trying to attract customers, some of these vendors are surprisingly cagey about the technology. Things that I thought were innocent beginner's questions were met with "I'm sorry we can't discuss that." The friendliest representative I encountered was at the <a href="https://www.motionanalysis.com">Motion Analysis</a> booth.</p>

<p>He explained the booth - which had a line of people waiting to try the zombie apocalypse shooter VR experience on display - is a cooperation between his motion-capture company and one of their customers who operates VR arcades with the zombie shooter experience. The motion tracker system's control computer was nearby and he walked me through the basics of how these systems track motion by correlating Â the imagery across their many cameras. I learned that the price tag for a system like that used by the zombie VR arcade have six to seven digits after the dollar sign, which means I'm definitely not getting one in my home anytime soon.</p>
<p>I did not expect to see 3D printer companies on the exhibit floor. Makerbot, Formlabs, and several other names I didn't know were present. I enjoyed getting a close look at all the finely detailed prints they can produce, I did not enjoy their associated price tags.</p>
<p>That is to be expected. It doesn't matter if we're talking about computer equipment, VR systems, motion capture, or 3D printer. This is an industry trade show displaying professional-level equipment that can stand up to commercial use. Not the hobbyist-level equipment that I'm more familiar with.</p>
<p>It was fun to see them up close and personal on the SIGGRAPH exhibit floor.</p>
