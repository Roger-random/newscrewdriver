<p>I've got one set of dead batteries <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/29/first-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-runtime-test/">upgraded and tested</a> and now attention turns to a different set of expired batteries. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/15/refurbished-dell-latitude-e6230-first-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I bought this refurbished Dell Latitude E6230 several years ago</a> intending to take apart and use as a robot brain. I changed my mind when it turned out to be a pretty nifty little laptop to take on the go, much smaller and lighter than my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/03/in-a-distorted-computer-component-market-buying-is-better-than-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dell Inspiron 7577</a>. With lower specs than the 7577, it also had longer battery run time and its performance didn't throttle as much while on battery. It has helped me field-program many microcontrollers and performed other mobile computing duties admirably.</p>

<p>I retired it from laptop duty when I got an Apple Silicon MacBook Air, but I brought it back out to serve as my introduction to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/27/home-assistant-os-in-kvm-hypervisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">running virtual machines under KVM hypervisor</a>. Retired laptops work well as low-power machines for exploratory server duty. Running things like Home Assistant haven't required much in the way of raw processing power, it was more important for a machine to run reliably around the clock while stashed unobtrusively in a corner somewhere. Laptops are built to be compact, energy-efficient, and already have a built-in battery backup. Though the battery usage pattern will be different from normal laptop use, which caused problems long term.</p>

<p>Before that happened though, this Latitude E6230 developed a problem starting up when warm. If I select "restart" it'll reboot just fine, but if I select "shut down" and press the power button immediately to turn it back on, it'll give me an error light pattern instead of starting up: The power LED is off, the hard drive LED is on, and the battery LED blinks. Given the blinking battery LED I thought it indicated a problem with the battery, but if I pull out the battery to run strictly on AC, I still see the same lights. The workaround is to leave the machine alone for 20-30 minutes to cool down, after which it is happy to start up either with or without battery.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But if the blinking battery LED doesn't mean a problem with the battery, what did it mean? I looked for the Dell troubleshooting procedure that would explain this particular pattern. I didn't get very far and, once I found the workaround, I didn't invest any more time looking. Acting as a mini-server meant it was running most of the time and rarely powered off. And if it does power off for any reason, this mini-server isn't running anything critical so waiting 20 minutes isn't a huge deal. I decided to just live with this annoyance for a long time, until the second problem cropped up recently:</p>

<p>Now when the machine is running, the battery LED blinks yellow. This time it <em>does </em>indicate a problem with the battery. The BIOS screen says "Battery needs to be replaced". The Ubuntu desktop gives me a red battery icon with an exclamation mark. And if I unplug the machine, there's zero battery runtime: the machine powers off immediately. (Which has to be followed by that 20 minute wait for it to cool down before I can start it up again.)</p>

<p>I knew keeping lithium-ion batteries at 100% full charge is bad for their longevity, so this was somewhat expected. I would have preferred the ability to limit state of charge at 80% or so. Newer Dell laptops like my 7577 have such an option in BIOS but this older E6230 did not. Given its weird warm startup issue and dead battery, low-power mini-server duty will now <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/31/dell-inspiron-7577-laptop-as-light-duty-server/">migrate to my Inspiron 7577</a>.</p>
