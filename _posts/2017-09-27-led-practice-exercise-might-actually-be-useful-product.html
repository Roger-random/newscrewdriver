<p>I set out to program a PIC to implement an I²C-controlled 4-digit 7-segment LED display because I thought it would be a decently nontrivial practice project to help me learn. I had fully expected it to end up duplicating the functionality of a commercially available product that does it better for a fraction of the price.</p>
<p>Now that my project is in a decently functional state, I went looking for that commercial product to see what else I can try to imitate for the sake of practice. I was surprised that nothing immediately stood out as both "does it better" <em><strong>and</strong></em> "fraction of the price".</p>
<p>The first item I found was sold by Adafruit. They have an I²C LED display "backpack" in various colors. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/880">Here's the green version</a>, as one example. The driver chip they used is the MAX7219, which I found curious because the data sheet for the chip does not mention I²C communication. Another curious item is that the complete kit - including populated circuit board and LED - has a list price of $9.95 but if I want to <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/453">buy the MAX7219 by itself from Adafruit</a> it costs the same $9.95. <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/pmic-display-drivers/729?k=MAX7219">Digi-Key sells the chip for around the same price</a>. I doubt Adafruit get their circuit board and LED for free, so there's something else I'm missing.</p>
<p>But I couldn't have used that chip anyway. The MAX7219 is for driving a display unit with common cathode, and LTC-4627JR is a common anode unit. Also, Maxim is <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/876">telling people to migrate their designs to the MAX6950</a>, which seems to be a surface-mount only chip with no DIP form factor available.</p>
<p>Looking over Sparkfun catalog I found a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11443">similar product</a>, but theirs is controlled by an ATMega328 chip. In fact, it is a baby Arduino complete with the Arduino bootloader. This is closer to what I've built, but I think the PIC is a simpler and less expensive chip to perform the task which may mean a small niche below the Sparkfun unit.</p>
<p>All this hints at the possibility my project might actually find an audience as a product. If I were to go ahead with this, I would test the market by putting it up on <a href="https://www.tindie.com/">Tindie</a>. It's a marketplace that seems to cater to the right audience and there doesn't seem to be a direct competitor product at the moment.</p>
<p>Well, that was unexpected. I might as well keep going and see how far I can take this.</p>
