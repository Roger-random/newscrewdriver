<p>I've learned some machine learning fundamentals through Codecademy Pro, and I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/12/window-shopping-kaggle-courses/">took a quick look at what Kaggle offered</a> for free. There's another option, from another name that (for better and worse) taken leadership in monetizing machine learning: Google. Their freely available <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course" target="_blank">Machine Learning Crash Course</a> supposedly started as a way for Google to get their own developers up to speed, and has since been made suitable for public consumption and now available for all.</p>

<p>My favorite part of this course was their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework" target="_blank">prerequisites &amp; prework page</a>. I used this as a guide to choose some of my courses on Codecademy Pro, it's how I knew Numpy and Pandas were important to the field. However their linked "UltraQuick Tutorial" for those libraries were a bit <em><strong>too </strong></em>terse for me. I have no doubt they provided enough background for people smarter than I am. Personally, I needed help from Codecademy to get ramped up on NumPy and Pandas.</p>

<p>For interactive learning, these courses use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>. Which feels a lot like Kaggle in the sense that they are both cloud-hosted Jupyter (or at least Jupyter style) notebooks. They differ by the server-end hardware, and the software images running on their hardware. I'm too new at this to have any feel of the tradeoffs between those two options, but I do understand the storage difference: Google Colab uses my Google Drive account for storage.</p>

<p>The primary reason I didn't go with this Machine Learning Crash Course was the fact that instructions came in the form of video lectures, and that turns me off. For self-directed education I prefer the written word because I can go at my own pace and I can easily search and skip around. Many people prefer video lectures as the most direct counterpart to in-person instruction, but I don't see it that way. For me the most valuable aspect of in-person instruction is the interactive question-and-answer aspect, which is completely lost in a video lecture.</p>

<p>And finally, this course does not cover reinforcement learning, which is my primary interest in applying machine learning. A search for RL on Google developer site leads to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/agents" target="_blank">the Agents library</a> and associated documentation, but that material was written to help apply reinforcement learning instead of teaching it. I'll return to the TensorFlow Agents library after <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/14/unity-machine-learning-agents-almost-within-my-reach/">getting ramped up on deep RL somewhere else</a>.</p>
