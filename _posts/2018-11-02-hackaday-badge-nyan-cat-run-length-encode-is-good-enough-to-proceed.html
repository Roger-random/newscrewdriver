<img class=" size-full wp-image-17086 alignright" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/poptartcat320240.gif" alt="poptartcat320240" width="320" height="240">At first glance, converting the Nyan Cat animated GIF to a run length encoded image doesn't make a lot of sense: I'd need to decode the GIF at some point anyway, why go through the effort?</p>
<p>The key point is that the conversion process can be done on a desktop PC, with far more powerful and user-friendly tools. Yes, I could have done the work to port a GIF library to the PIC32 chip running the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/161859-2018-hackaday-superconference-badge">Hackaday Superconference 2018 badge</a>, but on a desktop computer I could fire up Python, "<a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/handbook/tutorial.html">from PIL import Image</a>", and be off and running manipulating a decoded GIF image sequence.</p>
<p>Once I got over the (small) hump of initial learning, it was easy to write a Python script to do everything I wanted to do to the image:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downscale from original 400x400 resolution to 320x320</li>
<li>Crop off the top and bottom to obtain a 320x240 image</li>
<li>Perform run-length encoding of resulting image.</li>
<li>Output encoded bytes.</li>
</ol>
<p>In step 4, the output comes in the form of text: specifically, C source code. Each encoded image is a static C array declaration that I could copy and paste into MPLAB X for storage into PIC32 program memory.</p>
<p>I had hoped the simple GIF would compress well with run length encoding, and the first results were quite promising: a little over 2 kilobytes for the first frame, and there are 12 frames in total implying the neighborhood of 24-28 kilobytes.</p>
<p>The original Nyan Cat GIF takes up 30 kilobytes. Granted, it is higher resolution and different aspect ratio, but this is going to make the PIC32 side programming far <em><strong>FAR</strong></em> easier. Which not only makes it easier for me to write, but also for others to read and understand in a little demo. I'm willing to trade a bit of space for those benefits.</p>
<p>(The Python script used for Nyan Cat encoding lives in <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/transcode_gif">this minimal Github repository</a>.)</p>
