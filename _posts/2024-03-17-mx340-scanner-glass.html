<p>My old Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet is about as taken apart as I want it to be right now. After taking <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/03/16/mx340-disassembled-and-laid-out/">a big group photo of all the components</a>, I started gathering up the plastic that I don't plan to keep. That's when I noticed a loose end: two glass panels in the flatbed scanner assembly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/21/canon-pixma-mx340-scanner-rail/">Early in this teardown</a>, I discovered those panes of glass were much thicker than those used in LCD screens and thus far more robust than I had given them credit for. They also had nicely beveled edges so I'm much less likely to cut myself while handling them. Those two traits made it interesting to salvage those panes for my own use, but I forgot about them until now.</p>

<p>These two panes of glass were held with double-sided tape. It was not a surprise to discover the tape had yellowed and hardened, and the adhesive had dried up. It was pretty easy to peel both pieces of glass off their plastic frame.</p>

<p>Some residue was left behind as I peeled, but majority were easy to clean up. Some small streaks will need to be either scraped off with a razor or cleaned off with a solvent.</p>

<p>Underneath the glass is the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/12/03/canon-pixma-mx340-scanner-homing-marker/">image sensor homing marker</a>. I thought it was a thin piece of paper, but it was actually a more substantial sheet of plastic and I'm curious why it had to be this thick. It's almost as thick as the #11 knife blade I used to get started peeling off its adhesive.</p>

<p>I really doubt I'd reuse this homing marking for anything else, but it won't take much space to hang on to a thin strip of plastic for now. To preserve context I will keep it alongside its matching <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/12/06/canon-contact-image-sensor/">contact image sensor</a> bar so at least they're available if I think of something to do with that sensor. Fortunately, I have <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/03/18/mx340-teardown-complete-with-loose-ends-tied-up/">a convenient piece of cardboard</a> I can use to keep it with the sensor bar.</p>
