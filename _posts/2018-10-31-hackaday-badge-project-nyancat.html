<p>OK, enough probing and learning and experimenting with the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/80627-badge-for-hackaday-conference-2018-in-belgrade">Hackaday Belgrade 2018 badge</a>, it's about time I start writing something that I can put on its successor <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/161859-2018-hackaday-superconference-badge">Hackaday Supercon 2018 badge</a>. What to do?</p>
<p>For the purposes of a badge demo, it should explore areas of badge programming that aren't already present in existing badge firmware. Because that's what "demo" means - a demonstration.</p>
<p>I had been <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/10/22/hackaday-badge-lcd-screen/">fascinated by the LCD module from the start</a>, and the more I learn about it the more I feel it's been under-utilized by existing badge code. In keeping with the retro computing theme, almost everything on the badge are text-based, leaving the graphics capabilities of the badge largely unused. The ideal project would flex those visual muscles.</p>
<p>Another point of novelty on the badge is the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/10/21/hackaday-badge-audio/">audio subsystem</a>, consuming three of five timers, even more of the precious I/O pins on the chip, it'd be a shame to waste all those resources. I want to make it sing.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-17086 alignright" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/poptartcat320240.gif" alt="poptartcat320240" width="320" height="240">So, what sights and sounds shall I present as a demonstration? A brainstorming session with [<a href="http://amybaldwindev.com/">amybaldwindev</a>] produced a list of candidates. The top candidate was <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nyan-cat">Nyan Cat</a>Â the famed YouTube star. Now, the badge won't be able to play a YouTube video nor play its corresponding sound track. But the video's source was a relatively simple animated GIF, and others have already done work to <a href="https://musescore.com/sheetmusic?text=nyan+cat">simplify the soundtrack</a>.</p>
<p>Adapting an internet meme should make the result appealing to the Superconference audience. Making it an interesting technical demonstration project would almost end up being just a side bonus!</p>
<p>The only downside is that it doesn't fit with the retro computing theme, but I can live with that.</p>
