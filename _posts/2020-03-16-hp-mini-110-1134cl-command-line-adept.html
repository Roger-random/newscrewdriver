<p>So far I've determined a ~10 year old netbooks lack the computing power for a modern desktop graphical user interface, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/15/hp-mini-110-1134cl-ubuntu-mate-and-chrome-os-slow-even-with-ssd/">even those considered lightweight by today's standards</a>. Was it always sluggish even in its prime? It's a little hard to tell from here, because even though computers have undoubtedly gotten faster, our expectations have risen as well.</p>
<p>But there's more to a computer's capability than pushing pixels around, so we fall back to the next round of experiments with command line interface systems. And since we've already established that a solid state drive was not a great performance booster on this platform, I put the original spinning platter hard drive back in for the next round.</p>
<p>This time instead of Ubuntu Desktop, I installed Ubuntu server edition instead. This minimalist distribution lacks the user friendliness of a graphical user interface, but it also lacks the graphics processing workload of displaying one as well. As a result this machine is quite snappy and responsive. I found it quite usable, especially now that I've learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console">virtual consoles</a> and use the Alt key plus F1 through F6 to switch between up to six different sessions. Simple tasks like running Python scripts and running a basic server were done easily and quickly.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with Ubuntu 16, because Ubuntu did not release prebuilt installation binaries for 32-bit Ubuntu 18. However, once Ubuntu 16 server was and and running, I was able to run<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/installing-upgrading.html"><code>do-release-upgrade</code></a> to move up to Ubuntu 18. From minor tinkering I didn't notice any significant difference between them.</p>
<p>Then I remembered I had played with an even more minimalist Ubuntu earlier, on an even older machine. Ubuntu 18 Snappy Core is available for 32-bit i386 processors, and it installed successfully on this laptop. Now I have one more incentive to learn how to build my own snaps to install on such a system. I just have to remember to that I can only connect to an Ubuntu Snap machine via SSH, and the list of valid keys associated with an account <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1646559">do not auto-update</a>. I typically generate a SSH key every time I reset a machine, and I no longer have the keys to access my previous snappy core experiment. I ended up reinstalling snappy core to pick up the current set of SSH keys.</p>
