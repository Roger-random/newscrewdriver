<p>So far all of Sawppy tests have been performed as a client of a nearby wireless network. But we won't always have a network to connect to. Sawppy may venture where we don't have access privileges to a nearby network or possibly go places where there is no network at all.</p>
<p>This problem was encountered before on the SGVHAK rover project. The Raspberry Pi 3 on SGVHAK rover were modified to become its own wireless network access point by following <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md">directions posted on Raspberry Foundation website</a>. The downside of Pi configured to be its own network is that we lose the ability to connect to the internet. This is probably a problem that can be solved by diving deeper into Linux networking configuration but there was also the problem of limited power of Raspberry Pi's on-board wireless hardware.</p>
<p>As an experiment to reduce configuration headaches and to increase wireless power range, a <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-9_TL-WR802N.html">TP-Link TL-WR802N mini router</a> was added to the rover chassis. Now Sawppy the Rover has its own wireless network, giving us the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can use Raspberry Pi in its default configuration - no need to reconfigure Raspbian networking stack.</li>
<li>A wireless router is already designed to work to establish both (1) a standalone wireless network and simultaneously (2) have the ability to connect to an external wired network. Plug in an Ethernet cable and Sawppy is on the internet, no reconfiguration required.</li>
<li>A wireless router is already set up to be secure. TP-Link may or may not have covered all the bases, but it is expected to be more secure than a Raspberry Pi configured by a Linux networking amateur.</li>
<li>A dedicated wireless router has a more powerful wireless antenna.</li>
<li>Additional modules can be added to Sawppy and communicate over local wireless network. For example, adding a commodity wireless IP camera.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mini router is mounted to a stand bolted above the rear right corner. This location was chosen because that's where real Mars rover Curiosity's UHF communications antenna is mounted. Power for this little router comes from a micro-USB cable, so we could power it with another unit of the same power converter used to power the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>The TL-WR802N is a nice compact solution that avoided having to mess with Raspbian (Linux) networking and, more importantly, the risk of doing it wrong. It was also more powerful than a Raspberry Pi's on board wireless networking, but sadly not by as much as originally hoped.</p>
<p>Sometime in the future Sawppy will get a more powerful router for greater range, hopefully a dual-band unit to access the less crowded 5 GHz WiFi band. With more power and 5 GHz ability, Sawppy should have a better chance of tolerating <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/04/18/sgvhak-rover-and-predecessor-at-scale-16x/">noisy RF environments like SCaLE exhibit floor</a>.</body></html></p>
