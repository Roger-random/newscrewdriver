<p>This particular Mr. Robot Badge Mk. 2 was deemed a defective unit with several dark LEDs. I used it as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/04/07/surface-mount-repair-practice-with-mr-robot-badge/" target="_blank">a practice subject</a> for working with surface-mounted electronic devices, bringing two LEDs back into running order though one of them is the wrong color. Is the badge fully repaired? I couldn't quite tell. The default firmware is big on blinking and flashing patterns, making it difficult to determine if a specific LED is functioning or not. What I needed was a test pattern, something as simple as illuminate all of the LEDs to see if they come up. Fortunately, there was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.mrrobotbadge.tv/" target="_blank">a URL right on the badge</a> that took me to <a href="https://github.com/kscottz/MrRobotStarterPack">a GitHub repository</a> with sample code and instructions. It used Arduino framework to generate code for this ESP8266, and that's something I've worked with. I think we're in business.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the hardware side, I soldered sockets to the unpopulated programmer header and then created a programming cable to connect to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3KopLF6" target="_blank">my FTDI serial adapter</a> (*). For the software, I cloned the "Starter Pack" repository, followed installation directions, and encountered a build failure:</p>

<p>This looks like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pasko-zh/brzo_i2c/issues/44" target="_blank">issue #44 in the Brzo library</a>, unfixed at time of this writing. Hmm, this is a problem. Reading the code some more, I learned Brzo is used to create I2C communication routines with the IS31FL3741 driver chip controlling the LED array. Aha, there's a relatively easy solution. Since the time the badge was created, Adafruit has released <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-is31fl3741/" target="_blank">a product using the same LED driver chip</a> and corresponding software libraries to go with it. I could remove this custom I2C communication code using Brzo and replace it with Adafruit's library.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most of the conversion was straightforward except for the LED pixel coordinate lookup. The IS31Fl3741 chip treats the LEDs as a linear array, and something had to translate the linear index to their X,Y coordinates. The badge example code has a lookup table mapping linear index to X,Y coordinates. To use Adafruit library's frame buffer, I needed the reverse: a table that converts X,Y coordinates to linear index. I started typing it up by hand before deciding that was stupid: this is the kind of task we use computers for. So I wrote this piece of quick-and-dirty code to cycle through the existing lookup table and print the information back out organized by X,Y coordinates.</p>

<p>This gave me the numbers I needed in Arduino serial monitor, and I could copy it from there. Some spacing adjustment to make things a little more readable, and we have this:</p>

<p>This lookup table got Mr. Robot Badge Mk. 2 up and running without Brzo library! I could write that simple "turn on all LED" test I wanted.</p>

<p>The test exposed two more problematic LEDs. One of them was intermittent: I tapped it and it illuminated for this picture. If it starts flickering again, I'll give it a dab of solder to see if that helps. The other one is dark and stayed dark through (unscientific) tapping and (scientific) LED test equipment. It looks like I need to find two more surface-mount red LEDs to fully repair this array.</p>

<p>In case anybody else wants to play with Mr. Robot Badge and runs into the same problem, I have collected my changes and updated the README installation instructions in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/kscottz/MrRobotStarterPack/pull/3" target="_blank">pull request #3</a> of the badge code sample repository. If that PR rejected, <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/MrRobotStarterPack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clone my fork</a> directly.</p>
