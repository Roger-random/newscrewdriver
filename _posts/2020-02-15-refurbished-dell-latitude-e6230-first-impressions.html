<p>Dell's business oriented Latitude line command a price premium over their consumer grade Inspiron offerings, some of that money actually does go towards features for long term durability of those machines. A Latitude X1 I bought over a decade ago <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/11/27/dell-latitude-x1-is-almost-a-teenager/">is still running</a>. None of the Inspiron I've purchased has lasted nearly as long.</p>
<p>But despite their longevity, many businesses retire their computers on a regular schedule independent of actual condition. Once retired they go into a secondary market, a great opportunity for bargain hunters. Recently a batch of refurbished <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/latitude-e6230">Dell Latitude E6230</a> were on sale for $149 at Fry's Electronics and that was too good of a deal to pass up. For comparison, a new eighth-generation Core i5 processor is roughly $200 at retail, and that's just the processor. This refurbished machine has an old but still capable third-generation Core i5 processor at its heart, and an entire computer around it including storage, memory, display, and battery. The price/performance ratio here trounces <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/08/30/the-spectrum-of-ros-robot-brain-candidates/">every other candidate for a ROS robot brain</a>. Even the low cost leader, the Raspberry Pi, would have a hard time matching this price point after adding storage, display, battery, etc. In terms of computing power, an old Core i5 will have no problem leaving a Raspberry Pi in the dust.</p>
<p>I've had good luck with refurbished Dell computers so far. (Including that teenager Latitude X1.) So I thought I would pick up one of these units to see what I had to trade off for this screaming bargain. The answer is: not a whole lot.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--color-text);">The machine is very definitely used. There are visible wear and tear on exterior, but all purely cosmetic: discoloration of emblems, rubbed off paint, things along those lines.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19371" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dell-latitude-e6230-palm-rest-sticker.jpg" alt="Dell Latitude E6230 palm rest sticker" width="1600" height="900"></p>
<p>A typical sign of wear on an old laptop is the palm rest. I saw no wear at all in the palm rest area and was impressed until I realized what they had done: They've added a sticker over the palm rest to give it a new surface. The curled-up visible edge of this sheet gave the trick away. The surface of the touchpad, another frequent sign of age, also received the sticker treatment.</p>
<p>According to the documentation in its box, this laptop's refurbishment was performed by a company called <a href="http://www.astsys.com/">Advanced Skyline Technology, Ltd</a>. Side effect of a non-Dell refurbished computer are a few tradeoffs for cost. The AC power adapter is not a genuine Dell item, neither is the battery. However, the battery has the larger size of an extended runtime battery. If it actually offers longer runtime that would be a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>This machine came with a spinning platter hard disk, which I was not interested in using so the first project with this machine is to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/16/dell-latitude-e6230-hardware-internals/">open it up, look around its insides, and upgrade it to a solid state drive</a>.</p>
