<p>My <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/07/25/and-now-im-up-to-most-of-five-3d-printers/">herd of 3D printers has gained a new member</a>: a Geeetech A10. Or at least, most of one. It was a gift from <a href="https://twitter.com/stillashdesign">Ashley Stillson</a>, who retired this printer after moving on to other machines. Wear on the rollers indicated it has lived a productive life. Its age also showed from missing several of the improvements visible in the <a href="https://www.geeetech.com/geeetech-a10-3d-printer-new-upgraded-mother-board-lcd-frame-p-1117.html">product listing for the current version</a>. (And <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZY0Mnq">here it is on Amazon</a> *)</p>
<p>In addition to those new features, this particular printer is missing several critical components of a 3D printer. There is no print head to deposit melted plastic filament, it has no extruder to push filament into the print head. The Bowden tube connecting those two components are missing. There is no print bed to deposit filament on to, and there is no power supply to feed all the electrical appetite.</p>
<p>It does, however, still have all three motorized axis X, Y, and Z, and a logic board with control panel. X and Y axis still had their end stop switches, but the Z axis switch is absent leaving only a connector for the switch.</p>

<p>The only remnant of the power supply system is a XT60 plug. I don't use XT60 in my own projects and have none on hand, so I will either <a href="https://amzn.to/3hyHIlz">need to buy some</a> (*) or swap out the connector to match a power supply I have on hand.</p>

<p>It would take some work to bring it back into working condition as a 3D printer, but that's not important right now because my ideas for this chassis is not to bring it back to printing duty. I'm interested in putting its three-axis motion control capability. to other use. But first, I need to get its three axis moving, which means <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/07/27/power-input-replacement-for-geeetech-a10/">giving it some power</a>.</p>
