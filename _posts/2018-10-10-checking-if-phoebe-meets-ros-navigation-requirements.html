<p>Now that basic coordinate transform frames have been configured with help of URDF and robot state publisher, I moved on to the next document: <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup">robot setup page</a>. This one is actually listed slightly out of order list item on <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/navigation">ROS navigation page</a>, third behind the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Navigation%20Tuning%20Guide">Basic Navigation Tuning Guide</a>. I had started reading the "Tuning Guide" and saw that, in that introduction, the tuning guide assumes people have read the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup">robot setup page</a>. It's not clear why they are out of order, but clearly robot setup needs to come first.</p>
<p>Right up front in Section 1 "Robot Setup" was a very helpful diagram labelled "Navigation Stack Setup" showing major building blocks for an autonomously navigating ROS robot. Even better, these blocks are color-coded as to their source. White blocks are part of the ROS navigation stack, gray parts are optional components outside of that stack, and blue indicates robot-specific code to interface with navigation stack.</p>

<p>This gives me a convenient checklist to make sure Phoebe has everything necessary for ROS navigation. Clockwise from the right, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensor source - check! Phoebe has a Neato LIDAR publishing laser scan sensor messages.</li>
<li>Base controller - check! Phoebe has a Roboclaw ROS node executing movement commands.</li>
<li>Odometry source - check! This is also provided by the Roboclaw ROS node reading from encoders.</li>
<li>Sensor transforms - check! This is what we just updated, from a hard-coded published transform to one published by robot state publisher based on information in Phoebe's URDF.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was the easy part. Section 2 was more opaque to this ROS beginner. It gave an overview of the configuration necessary for a robot to run navigation, but the overview assumes a level of ROS knowledge that's at the limit of what I actually have in my head right now. It'll probably take a few rounds of trial and error before I get everything up and running.</p>
