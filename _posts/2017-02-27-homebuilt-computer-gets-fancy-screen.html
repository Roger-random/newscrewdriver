<p>The time pressure of making it ready for show-and-tell at the February Hackaday LA meet meant I hadn't been documenting my lessons learned here.</p>
<p>Which is a shame, because there were quite a few 3D printing lessons learned while building this thing. I briefly mentioned a few of them on the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/19583-luggable-pc/log/54071-threaded-rod-box-v2">project log update up on Hackaday.io</a> but I intend to find the time to expand on those ideas as future posts on this blog. I just hope I can get them all written down before I forget.</body></html></p>
