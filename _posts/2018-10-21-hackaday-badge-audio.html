<img class=" size-full wp-image-17025 alignright" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hackaday-badge-audio.png" alt="Hackaday Badge Audio" width="296" height="225">After looking at the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/80627-badge-for-hackaday-conference-2018-in-belgrade">Hackaday Belgrade 2018 badge</a>'s onboard RGB LED, I moved on to looking over the audio subsystem to see how it accomplished its three-voice audio functionality. My first guess was that music playback was handled by a peripheral of some sort. On<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/80627/gallery#516d5bd730684b8318e2fa9119565b8f"> the board schematic</a> I saw that the speaker was connected to a chip labelled LM4890 so it seemed like an obvious candidate for audio peripheral. However, after downloading and reading the datasheet for LM4890, I learned the chip only functions as an amplifier to take a low-powered audio waveform (via pins labeled <code>+IN</code> and <code>-IN</code>) as input and push that same waveform out at a speaker-appropriate level of power. So yes, it is a dedicated audio peripheral, but not a tone or music generator.</p>
<p>So where's the music coming from? I see on the schematic capacitors and resistors but nothing else that would generate sound waves, except maybe what's connected to the PIC32's pins <code>D0</code> through <code>D3</code>. Perhaps the PIC32 has a built-in music peripheral?</p>
<p>Looking in the code, I started tracing from the BASIC side with the <code>tune</code> statement, handled by <code>tune_statement</code> in <a href="https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/basic-badge/blob/master/firmware/badge1.X/src/basic/ubasic.c">ubasic.c</a>. It calls <code>sound_play_notes</code> in <a href="https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/basic-badge/blob/master/firmware/badge1.X/src/hw.c">hw.c</a>. A few more straightforward C call tracing ended at <code>sound_set_generator</code> which flips some hardware control bits and puts the desired frequency in a hardware register. What are the results of these actions?</p>
<p>Searching on the specific keywords in <code>set_sound_generator</code> didn't get me anywhere immediately. Reading the code more carefully led to a key insight: for sound generator 0, it deals with the number 2. For generator 1, number 3, and for generator 2, number 4. After running around in circles for a bit, I figured out these are PIC32 hardware timer peripherals. These bits control PIC hardware timers 2, 3, and 4 whose actions are handled by <code>Timer2Handler</code>, <code>Timer3Handler</code>, and <code>Timer4Handler</code> in hw.c. Every time the timer interrupt fires, the handler inverts a pin named <code>GEN_0_PIN</code> / <code>GEN_1_PIN</code> / <code>GEN_2_PIN</code> defined to be <code>LATDbits.LATD1</code> / <code>LATDbits.LATD2</code> / <code>LATDbits.LATD1</code> which matches up with the PIC32 pins on the schematic.</p>
<p>So it's not a <em>music</em> peripheral like I originally guessed. They are three of the PIC32's generic timer peripherals, each used to toggle a pin on and off at a set frequency. These three timers are responsible for the three voices, whose waveforms are merged and sent into a LM4890 chip (lower center of picture below) to drive the speaker (center of picture).</p>
