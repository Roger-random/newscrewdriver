The event itself featured a lot of groups affiliated with <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a> showing what they have offer to the visiting public. The weather cooperated with a nice sunny day for people to stop in for a look.</p>
<p><a href="https://pasadena.edu/">Pasadena City College</a>, which is basically next door, had a strong presence with many student groups showing off their projects. Here's a machine that takes poker chips in a chute (right) and sorts them by color into bins (lower left).</p>

<p>JPL brought in some model rover wheels. These were not made with the same material of real rover wheels, but they are actual size. They represent the wheels of <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-pathfinder-sojourner-rover/">Sojourner</a>, the <a href="https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/home/index.html">Spirit/Opportunity</a> twins, and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/">Curiosity</a> rover.</p>

<p>Our SGVHAK rover started the day sitting on the table.</p>

<p>But it didn't take long before the rover hit the road and started demonstrating its chops by climbing some bricks.</p>

<p>A demonstration of suspension capability is to sit down in front and let the rover climb over your legs. One of the times this was demonstrated, it caught the attention of a bunch of children who ran and lined up to be run over too.</p>

<p>All this climbing was great, but it took a toll on the rover. The stresses started loosening up some screws and the right-front wheel started dangling on one final loose screw.</p>

<p>A little field repair was in order - stealing screws from elsewhere on the rover to get it back up and running again.</p>
