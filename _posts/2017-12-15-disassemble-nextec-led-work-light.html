<p>Today's project is to disassemble the NEXTEC LED work light and see if we can use it to adapt an old Black &amp; Decker BHD9600CHV Dustbuster to lithium-ion power.</p>
<p>The wish list of the disassembly operation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery compartment: If we could use the battery compartment of the work light, don't have to reverse engineer the dimensions of the battery pack and the slots needed to clip the battery in place.</li>
<li>Battery connector: If we could use the battery connector of the work light, we don't have to reverse engineer the precise location and dimension of the metal contacts for drawing power from the battery.</li>
<li>Battery over-discharge protection: Unlike Ni-Cad batteries' tolerance of discharge, over-discharging lithium-ion cells could cause permanent damage. As a result, most lithium-ion devices have a protection circuit and I'd like to pull that in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The things we don't care about:</p>
<ul>
<li>LED array: There are plenty of LEDs of all color and brightness on every electronic tinkerer's workbench. One fewer array would not be missed.</li>
<li>Switch: The work light's switch is the type where a press closes the circuit, then another press opens the circuit. This is the right behavior for a light but not for a vacuum. Also: this switch was designed for a low-amperage LED and while it looks sufficiently beefy, it might not tolerate the amperage draw of a Dustbuster motor.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these goals in mind we start with the obvious task of removing the four visible screws. After the screws were removed there was one more fastener: a small metal C-clip holding the two halves together near where the pinkie finger rests while holding the light. The clip was designed to require a specific tool for a clean removal. For people who are unconcerned about cosmetic damage, it could be persuaded to abandon its post with pliers.</p>

<p>Looking at the disassembled light, we see we can easily re-purpose the battery compartment and associated battery connector for the project. The third item on the wish list - the over-discharge protection circuit - is unfortunately incorporated onto the LED circuit board and not an easily separated part. We'll just have to be careful when using the upgraded Dustbuster and not discharge it too much.</p>
<p>Having the battery compartment and electrical contacts is great. It bypasses a lot of iterative CAD work and 3D printing to pin down proper dimensions to fit the battery. The next step is to join the two devices together.</p>
