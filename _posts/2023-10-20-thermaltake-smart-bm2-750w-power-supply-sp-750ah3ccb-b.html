<p>I've just <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/19/two-broken-120mm-12vdc-pc-cooling-fans/">disposed of two salvaged cooling fans</a>, and now I'm going to pick up a bigger one.</p>

<p>This Thermaltake power supply unit (PSU) was retired because it would turn on and run for only a short time (less than ten minutes, sometimes only a few seconds) then the computer would shut down. The fan turns, so it's probably not simple overheating. Since it turns on, it's not as simple as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/12/11/high-power-600w-power-supply-hp1-j600gd-f12s/" target="_blank">a blown fuse</a>. But at least it didn't <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/05/antec-atx-power-supply-failure-ea-650-green/">fill my room with smoke</a>, so that's good.</p>

<p>It's a shame this PSU died because it's got nice specs, along with the convenience feature of modular connectors reducing wiring clutter inside the case.</p>

<p>Six screws held two halves of the enclosure together. Once removed I could slide them apart.</p>

<p>The 140mm fan is connected via a commodity JST-XH header, making it easy to repurpose.</p>

<p>This 140mm fan is larger than the 120mm fan I had just worked with, which on paper moves more air even as the fan turns at a slower (and thus quieter) speed. I'm curious to see if it is true, but I have to find a place for it first. This will be my first 140mm fan and I'm not sure what I'll do with it just yet.</p>

<p>Here's an inside view of those modular connectors, implemented as a collection of circuit board connectors. The power wires leading to this connector board is very hefty. Lettering on the insulation says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12AWG</a>.</p>

<p>There were no obviously failed components inside this PSU.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And I see no obviously burned traces on the back of the circuit board. It's a shame a high-spec PSU had to be retired, but I don't like to take the risk of unreliable power. Bad power could damage far more expensive components (CPU, GPU, SSD) plus the annoyance factor of a computer that randomly shuts down. It's just not worth it.</p>
