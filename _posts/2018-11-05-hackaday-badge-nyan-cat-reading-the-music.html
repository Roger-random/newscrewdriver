<p>The <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/80627-badge-for-hackaday-conference-2018-in-belgrade">Hackaday Belgrade 2018 badge</a> (and its successor, the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/161859-2018-hackaday-superconference-badge">Hackaday Superconference 2018 badge</a>) has a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/10/21/hackaday-badge-audio/">simple audio system</a> driving a speaker with up to three simultaneous tones. In order to give the Nyan Cat animation an appropriate soundtrack, I'd need to reduce its YouTube soundtrack to a few simple notes. Fortunately, people who are more knowledgeable about music have already <a href="https://musescore.com/sheetmusic?text=Nyan+Cat">done the work and shared them</a> in sheet music format.</p>
<p>But there was a big problem: neither [<a href="http://www.amybaldwindev.com/">amybaldwindev</a>] or I knew how to read music.</p>
<p>We did what anyone would do in this day and age: search for "How to read sheet music" and <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com/blog/2014/04/11/how-to-read-sheet-music/">read the first link</a>. For the purpose of this specific project, I was not concerned with understanding the notes on the staff as I only needed to match them up against the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/161859-2018-hackaday-superconference-badge/log/154557-music-syntax-and-guide">reference chart</a> on the badge music page. The duration of each note, however, proved more challenging. On several occasions we thought a note sounded wrong but it turned out just to be their duration</p>
<p>We started with <a href="https://musescore.com/namvet/scores/50457">a piano adaptation</a>, but several attempts at translating it to badge music format failed to create something that sounded like Nyan Cat. Eventually we switched toÂ <a href="https://musescore.com/user/179139/scores/170886">this version</a> - intended for violin - whose translated result running on the badge sounded like we were on the right track.</p>
