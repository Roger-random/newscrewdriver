<p>I want to understand the Angular Signals code lab project beyond what was set up for signals practice. While learning why layout for <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> looks funny, I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/31/angular-signals-code-lab-css-requires-no-quirks-mode/">stumbled across CSS quirks mode</a> which I hadn't known before. And since I'm already in a CSS mindset, I stayed on topic to understand a few places where the sample app used CSS to create aesthetic visuals.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first item I wanted to understand was a large list of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in <code>index.html</code>, taking up more than half of the lines in the file. I originally thought it had something to do with the alphabet cipher keyboard, but it was actually implementation of the fake speaker grill. CSS class <code>.sound-grid</code> is a grid of 8 columns filled with a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> styled to be a small circle. There were 48 of them to create 6 rows in those 8 columns. Some of these circles are dark representing holes, some light representing... something else, and four corner circles were transparent to de-emphasize the rectangular nature of a grid.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That was kind of neat. And the next item I wanted to understand was the green screen display resembling a monochrome LED like an old Game Boy. I was curious how the graph paper grid was implemented, and the answer is a CSS linear gradient (class <code>.message::before</code>) given parameters to be very <em><strong>not</strong></em> smooth in the gradient transition in order to create a grid. I was mildly confused looking at the gradient and text styles, as they are all working in grayscale. The answer is another piece of CSS (<code>.message::after</code>) that gave a green tint over the entire screen area plus a bit of blur for good effect.</p>

<p>While these are nifty creations, I am curious why CSS was used here. Both the fake speaker and screen grid feel like vector graphic tasks, which I had thought was the domain of either SVG (if via markup) or canvas (if via code). What's the advantage of using CSS instead? Sure, it worked in this case, but it feels like using the wrong tool for the job. I hope to eventually learn reasons beyond "because we can". For now, I turn my attention to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/02/angular-signals-code-lab-drag-drop-letters/">other functional bits of this sample application</a>.</p>
