<p>Every time I encounter problems at a public Sawppy appearance, it is a lesson. It might be a lesson in how I might be able to improve Sawppy's design, or it might be a lesson in how to better prepare a kit for field repairs a.k.a. Sawppy First Aid Kit. When a fuse burnt out <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/03/16/sawppy-at-caltech-science-for-march-2019/">at Caltech Science for March 2019</a>, that was easy to address: add replacement fuses to the kit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/03/09/cracked-sawppy-steering-coupler-almost-survives-full-day-of-scale-17x/">broken servo coupler encountered at SCaLE 17x</a> was a little tougher. It wasn't enough to keep an extra 3D-printed coupler handy, because a little block of plastic isn't very useful by itself. It requires a heat set insert to accommodate a set screw holding against an 8mm shaft, and it requires four more screws to fasten against the servo horn. Fiddling with a lot of tiny screws would not be very practical when trying to make field repairs away from my workbench. This is especially true when I have a literal 'field' to deal with: on grassy grounds where a lost screw is very difficult to recover.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-18163 aligncenter" style="color:var(--color-neutral-600);" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sawppy-servo-coupler-fru.jpg" alt="Sawppy servo coupler FRU" width="1600" height="740"></p>
<p>The answer to minimizing chance of lost screw is to prepare a replacement assembly consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D-printed coupler</li>
<li>Heat-set insert already installed.</li>
<li>Set screw already installed inside the heat-set insert.</li>
<li>Servo horn that comes with a serial bus servo.</li>
<li>4 small screws already fastening the coupler to the servo horn.</li>
</ul>
<p>With such an assembly ready to go, the only fastener I risk losing during replacement is the screw holding the servo horn to the servo output spline.</p>
<p>The first downside of this approach is that I only have as many servo horns as serial bus servos. Keeping a replacement unit ready in Sawppy's field repair kit means I have an extra serial bus servo with no horn to use it. Perhaps I could purchase extra servo horns, or maybe this is just a hint I should also have an extra replacement servo in the bag.</p>
<p>The second downside of this approach is that, in case of steering couplers, a replacement would not be identical. Steering trim would be slightly different with a replacement coupler due to natural variation from unit to unit. When I perform this replacement, I would also have to adjust Sawppy's steering trim for proper operation. But in an emergency? It'll probably be close enough.</p>
