<p>The default printing surface that shipped with a <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=13860">Monoprice Maker Select</a> feels similar to <a href="https://www.buildtak.com">BuildTak</a>. It is a good general purpose surface but some other materials will work better for specific plastic filaments and/or better fit personal preferences. Upon recommendation of <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/08/30/review-monoprice-maker-ultimate-3d-printer/">this Hackaday printer review</a>, I tried a PEI surface. My experience using it for printing <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=10552">Monoprice PLA</a> has been stellar. So now that we have a <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=21864">second hand open-box Maker Select printer</a> whose print surface was well used by the previous owner, the solution is obvious.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-15941 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pei-0-scuffed-surface.jpg" alt="PEI 0 - scuffed surface" width="1024" height="576"></p>
<p>We could try to squeeze a little more life out of this surface, or replace it with a fresh sheet that came with the printer, but now that the printer has proven to be sufficiently functional we're going straight to <a href="https://amzn.to/2mrp1th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sheet of PEI purchased from GizmoDorks' Amazon store</a> (*).</p>
<p>The first step is to remove the sheet. Historically most adhesives are easier to remove when warm and this is conveniently a heated bed. Setting the bed temperature to 40 degrees C warms things up a bit without risking skin burn. It peels off leaving only minor residue behind to be cleaned up.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-15942 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pei-1-peel.jpg" alt="PEI 1 - Peel" width="1011" height="1024"></p>
<p>The PEI sheet is 8" x 8" which is only a tiny bit larger than the official 200mm x 200mm print area. It is definitely smaller than the sheet of aluminum on the printer. This means we should put in a bit of effort finding the proper position for the sheet on the bed. Fortunately the well-used surface clearly shows where the hot nozzle touches when homing at the start of a print, giving us our axis origin which we can mark off with a bit of masking tape.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-15943 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pei-1a-zero.jpg" alt="PEI 1a - Zero" width="1015" height="1024"></p>
<p>The PEI sheet is then placed against this origin to test for fit. We see that the upper-left corner conflicts with the screw used to level the bed.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-15945 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pei-3-align.jpg" alt="PEI 3 - Align" width="1024" height="913"></p>
<p>PEI is brittle enough we can use a knife to cut the surface of the sheet at that corner and breaking a little bit off to clear the screw. After that we can peel off the adhesive backing and stick the PEI sheet on the bed. When doing this - check twice and commit! I hesitated and tried to adjust, which put a little wrinkle in the adhesive. This is visible towards the upper left. Thankfully the wrinkle didn't noticeably affect top surface flatness, so I just have to live with a slightly crooked PEI sheet and a cosmetic blemish wrinkle.</p>
