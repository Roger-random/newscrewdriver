<p>With the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/24/amazon-fire-sr043kl-backlight-layers/">successful relight</a> of a salvaged Amazon Fire tablet backlight, I'm ready to begin the final chapter of my journey with this Acer Aspire Switch 10 (SW5-012). I'm not the original owner of this machine, so it was never my day-to-day computer. It was retired when it would no longer power-up, and the charger has been lost in the time it was sitting around gathering dust. That nonworking state was how I got it as something to play with.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I diagnosed the power-up problem to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/12/03/acer-aspire-disabled-by-loose-cable/" target="_blank">a loose cable</a>, and I worked around the lost charger with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/12/05/no-ac-adapter-no-problem-alternate-power-source-for-an-acer-aspire-switch/" target="_blank">hacked-up power connector</a>. That was enough for me to power this system back up. I found it <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/12/06/acer-aspire-switch-is-linux-unfriendly/">didn't want to run Linux</a>, but it could <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/12/07/acer-aspire-switch-runs-windows-10-fall-creators-update/" target="_blank">run modern Windows 10</a> surprisingly well. And I didn't even have to buy another Windows license, as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/01/07/windows-10-can-activate-with-windows-8-hardware-key/" target="_blank">Windows 8 license embedded in hardware</a> seemed to work just fine. And I undertook some projects like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/01/15/remove-camera-from-acer-aspire-switch-10/" target="_blank">removing its webcam module</a> for security. Because no hacker on the internet can activate a webcam that's sitting detached in a zip lock bag in another room.</p>

<p>But a computer that runs modern Windows 10 "surprisingly well" for its age is not the same as a computer that runs it well in a useful sense. It's still an old computer showing its age across the board. Limited RAM, cramped storage, and most personally unsatisfying for me, a low resolution screen. The CPU is not the ill-fated Clover Trail series, but it is still quite slow and is a 32-bit only CPU cut off from modern features of 64-bit operating systems. 32-bit support has already been dropped by MacOS, Ubuntu, even <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/15/hp-mini-110-1134cl-ubuntu-mate-and-chrome-os-slow-even-with-ssd/">Chrome OS is 64-bit only</a> nowadays.</p>

<p>Finally the system failed again, with the familiar symptom of failing to power up when the power button is pressed. However, this time it was not the loose cable and I failed to find another explanation. It was then retired and I performed a partial disassembly, pulling out its mainboard for <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/29/hot-air-station-amateur-hour/">a play with a hot air rework station</a>.</p>

<p>I think it is time for me to finish the teardown the rest of the way. The battery pack has already been freed and I think that two-cell lithium ion pack has a future in another project down the line. That leaves the screen, whose low resolution makes it uninteresting as a display but now with two backlight projects under my belt I'm going to see if I can salvage this backlight. Then I'll see what else might be interesting to salvage from this machine.</p>

<p>Most of what's left on this convertible laptop main unit were glued together, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/22/amazon-fire-sr043kl-screen-removal/" target="_blank">I hate fighting glue</a> which is why it halted my earlier teardown. But I have to do it if I want that backlight, so I started thinking about heating up the module to soften the glue. I used to do this with a heat gun, and with the Amazon Fire tablet I used the heated print bed of a retired 3D printer. But we're now entering the uncomfortably hot phase of Southern California summer. So there's no need to consume electricity: I can just set this thing out on a brick and let it warm up in the sun and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/26/acer-aspire-switch-10-sw5-012-bottom-plate/">turn my attention to the base section</a>.</p>
