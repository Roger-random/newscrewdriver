<p>I'm slowly taking apart my retired Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet, and I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/01/26/canon-pixma-mx340-control-panel-round-2-summary/">wrapped up my second pass examination of control panel electronics</a>. Now I will switch attention to its paper feed motor assembly. First of all, calling it the paper feed motor is an understatement, I just don't have a better name. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/24/canon-pixma-mx340-paper-feed-motor-gearbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Looking at gears and shafts on my first pass</a>, I knew it is linked to several other mechanisms beyond feeding paper. I got a close look at how it can <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/25/canon-pixma-mx340-paper-output-tray-door/">open the paper tray door</a> at the front of the machine, but everything else is still buried out of sight at the moment.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>They are still buried because I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/27/canon-pixma-mx340-teardown-phase-1-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paused physical disassembly</a> in order to ensure the machine remain in a running state. This was very useful as I probed electronic control and communication signals while it was running live. I gained far more insight this way than I could have if I couldn't run the machine. I learned a lot about the document feeder, the scanner, and how the main board communicates with the control panel. After all that, though, I'm close to exhausting everything <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/28/canon-pixma-mx340-electronics-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within my current skill level to understand</a>. But I think there's one or two more things I can do before I pick up the screwdriver again.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I want to record paper feed motor mechanism's behavior. I can see with my eyes it turn forward and backwards multiple times at different speeds. There's a sequence that runs upon power up, another one when it goes into standby, and naturally there is much more when the machine prepares to actually put ink on paper. I want to quantify that motion more precisely than what I can see with my own eyes. This way, in the likely event the machine stops running as a result of future disassembly, I have something to reference. Correlating them with mechanisms that probably won't run by the time I disassemble the machine far enough to get to them. I need to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/01/28/canon-pixma-mx340-paper-feed-motion-recording-objectives/">quantify exactly what I want to record</a>, then go look for tools that can help me do it.</p>
