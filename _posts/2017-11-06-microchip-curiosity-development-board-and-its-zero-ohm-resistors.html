<p>When I purchased my batch of PIC16F18345 chips, Microchip offered 20% discount off standard price for its <a href="http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DM164137">corresponding Curiosity development board (DM164137)</a>. I thought it might be interesting and added it to my order, but I hadn't pulled it out of its packaging until today.</p>
<p>Today's motivation is the mTouch button built onto the board. As part of my investigation into projects I might tackle with the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/27427-camera-badge-for-supercon-2017">Hackaday Superconference 2017 camera badge</a>, I found that the capacitive touch capabilities of the MCU is unused and thought it might be interesting to tie it into the rest of the camera badge. Before I try to fabricate my own touch sensors, I thought it'd be a good idea to orient myself with an existing mTouch implementation. Enter the Curiosity board.</p>
<p>Looking over the board itself and the schematics on the user's guide, I noticed a generous scattering of zero ohm surface-mount resistors. If I had seen zero ohm resistors in isolation, I would have been completely mystified.Â Many electronics beginner like myself see a zero ohm resistors as something that does nothing, take up space, and there's no point. For those beginners, a web search would have led them to <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/42756/what-is-the-usage-of-zero-ohm-miliohm-resistor">this StackExchange thread</a>, possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-ohm_link">the Wikipedia article</a>, or maybe the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/12/03/the-zero-ohm-resistor/">Hackaday post</a>.</p>

If I wanted to change which pins connected to which peripherals, I would not have to cut traces on the circuit board, I just had to un-solder the zero ohm resistor. Then I can change the connection on the board by soldering to the empty through-holes placed on the PCB for that purpose.</p>
<p>This was an illuminating "Oh that makes sense!" introduction to zero ohm resistors.</p>
