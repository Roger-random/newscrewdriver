<p>While fiddling with my HTML experiments, I start feeling the need to keep different versions around and the desire to undo experiments (successes and failures both.)</p>
<p>I hadn't planned to dive into version control for a while longer, but this is enough of a motivation for me to dive in starting with the Codecademy "<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git">Learn Git</a>" class.</p>
<p>This class has <em><strong>significantly</strong> <strong>less</strong> </em>hand-holding than the last few Codecademy classes I took, and almost no repetition. It also doesn't go into a reasons <em><strong>why</strong> </em>you are doing what you are doing in a class. As a result, I felt this class would not be a good introduction for a raw beginner.</p>
<p>To successfully complete this class, the student needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be comfortable with a command line.</li>
<li>Already know why you'd want to use version control.</li>
<li>Navigate the in-class environment without instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one was annoying. At one point in the class, the student is expected to open a file in the virtual work environment to be edited, but there was no instruction on how to do so.</p>
<p>The class worked perfectly for me - I could handle the above bullets, and the lack of repetition meant I was never bored. The lack of hand-holding meant I had to occasionally <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">look up git commands</a> on my own, or hunt around the UI of the work environment, but it wasn't bad. I'm just not sure it's good starting place for a coding beginner.</p>
<p>Setting aside the class <em>material </em>for now: the class <em>implementation</em> was interesting. I had expected the class learning environment to be merely a facade. Something that only accepts text input in the exact order required in the instructions. It turns out not to be the case - it appears to be a real (though restricted) instance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash</a>, connected to (a limited set of) git commands. I could issue any valid commands in the environment, and they would run!</p>
<p>Of course, if I veer off the course I couldn't go to the next step, but I was impressed that they have created a sandbox for the student to play in.</body></html></p>
