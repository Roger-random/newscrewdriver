<p>I want to see how much I can understand of the scanner image sensor bar I pulled out of a Canon MX340 multi-function inkjet. A little <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/12/06/canon-contact-image-sensor/">research side quest</a> helped me feel better prepared for the task of figuring out what happens over the twelve wires connecting the sensor bar to the printer main board.</p>

<p>Looking at the copper traces on the circuit board, I can see some of them are directly wired to the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/12/05/canon-pixma-mx340-scanner-led/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pins for LED illumination</a>. Verifying continuity between those connector pins and LED pins identified the left-most five of twelve wires. Probing for continuity with chassis ground, I found one more ground wire. Measuring the remaining wires while the system is powered up, I found one pin that held steady at 3.3V. A good power source candidate for image sensor logic.</p>

<p>That left five unknowns whose voltages fluctuate. Too quickly for my volt meter to catch what's happening, hinting at data signals. My oscilloscope has four channels so I need to choose four to solder wires to and leave one for later.</p>

<p>This connector also has 1.0mm pitch and this time I managed to solder wires without creating bridges. Luck or improving skill I don't know yet, either way I expect my MX340 teardown project will give me many more practice opportunities.</p>

<p>I turned on the MX340 and saw this on my oscilloscope screen. The yellow wire is attached to a pretty steady wave at 2.375MHz, possibly a clock signal. Its adjacent red and blue wires seem to track pretty closely to each other, the green wire looks much the same but at roughly 1V higher.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's pretty much everything I got. I see this pattern as soon as the printer powers up, and it looks much the same during the homing sequence and afterwards. I waved my hand and shined a light at the sensor bar and saw no significant change in these signals. If I were looking at LVDS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-voltage_differential_signaling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Wikipedia</a> I should see a 350mV change, but I don't.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>That said, there is something that occasionally flashes past this screen, but I didn't know how to isolate it yet. Whatever it was, it occurred too infrequently to be image data. (Later I would determine it is a line sync signal on the red wire.)</p>

<p>Could the magical data wire be the fifth and final wire I had yet to examine? On paper it was a 20% chance I missed the most important wire, but Murphy's Law raises those odds. Besides, I'm so close and it'd be silly to give up now. I turned off the printer and oscilloscope and turned on the soldering iron. The green wire was moved one pin over, and I tried again.</p>

<p>Jackpot! I have a candidate <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/12/08/canon-pixma-mx340-contact-image-sensor-signal/">image sensor data signal</a>.</p>
