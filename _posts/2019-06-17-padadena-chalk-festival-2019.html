<p>This past weekend was spent looking over artists working intently at Paseo Colorado for <a href="https://pasadenachalkfestival.com/">Pasadena Chalk Festival 2019</a>. I feel it is to chalk artists what <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/06/supercon-badge-hackers-racing-the-clock/">badge hacking at Supercon</a> are for electronics people. Since I never graduated beyond the kindergarten stage of chalk art, I learned about surprising variety of tools and techniques for applying chalk to concrete. As someone who loves to learn about behind-the-scenes of every creation, it's fun to revisit certain favorite pieces to see them progress through the weekend.</p>
<p>There were many original works, but most of my attention were focused on recreations of animated characters and scenes I've already seen. A notable departure from this pattern was a large mural depicting space exploration including my favorite Mars rover Curiosity:</p>

<p>Monsters, Inc. characters by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deyalit_jacobo/">Jazlyn Jacobo</a>:</p>
<p>[gallery ids="18675,18676,18677,18678" type="rectangular" link="file"]</p>
<p>Kiki's Delivery Service:</p>

<p>Aladdin's Genie and Carpet play a game of chess. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenn.art.01/">Drawn by Jen</a>:</p>

<p>A scene from Toy Story 4 teaser, drawn in front of the theater which will be playing the movie next weekend. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gus.moran/">Drawn by Gus Moran</a>:</p>

<p>Lion Kings Simba and Mufasa <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kathleensanders/">by Kathleen Sanders</a>. This was quite fitting since it was also Father's day:</p>

<p>Grandfather and grandson from Coco feature in this highly detailed composition by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/infinitepatty/">Patty Gonzalez</a>:</p>

<p>Other works I liked:</p>

<p>This artist, who is drawing a chalk portrait of Luke Skywalker as X-Wing pilot, brought along a 3D prop in the form of a full-sized R2-D2.</p>

<p>The most novel piece was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cnickartist/">by C.Nick</a> in the Animation Alley. Here I expected to find artists working with animated characters... I was delighted to find an actual animated chalk drawing.</p>
