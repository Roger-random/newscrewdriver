<p>After I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/20/amazon-fire-sr043kl-mainboard/">moved the mainboard</a> more-or-less out of the way, my next objective was to remove the glued-in battery. This is not just annoying, it is potentially dangerous as lithium polymer pouch batteries like these aren't very fond of gross physical abuse. And they have a history of protesting their displeasure with a fireworks show in your face! There were two ways forward: I could leave it alone and hope it doesn't block anything important, or I can remove it now to uncover whatever is underneath and remove a point of volatility from the project. I decided to remove it.</p>

<p>The battery is pretty much surrounded on all sides, but I saw Amazon engineers left a small opening as an entry point. Here it is marked after the fact.</p>

<p>I didn't see an applicable tool in my iFixit repair toolkit, so I cut apart a piece of thermoformed plastic packaging for a thin and flexible spatula to dig in. I found the bottom strip of tape, and after that I was freed, I could work my way around to free the battery from the remaining three strips. That is a total of four strips of double-sided tape, one for each edge of the battery.</p>

<p>Thankfully the battery did not explode in my face, but I'm not entirely sure it came out unscathed, either. There were some very definitely flexing as I pulled it freed from these four tape strips, because at the time I didn't know exactly where they all were. Perhaps with a bit of hindsight I could free the battery while putting less stress on it, but I could at least document my findings so maybe the next person who sees this can treat their battery better.</p>

<p>During all of this yanking and pulling of battery removal, I flexed the touch digitizer cable one too many times and it broke. Oops. Well, at least now the mainboard has been completely freed from the case.</p>

<p>Earlier I thought this Kapton-covered segment might have been soldered to the board and didn't want to pull too hard. Now that I'm no longer worried about damaging this already-damaged part, I stabbed a flat tool in there to release the bond. It turns out there was no soldering, just a piece of tenacious double-sided tape.</p>

<p>There were a few other trivial items accessible from the back of the tablet, including the external speaker, microphones, and switches for external buttons. I was moderately curious about these items, but I had actually hoped to find something that would help me release components on the front side of the tablet. Alas, I found nothing, which meant there's only one thing to do: <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/22/amazon-fire-sr043kl-screen-removal/">start fighting glue</a>.</p>
