<p>Digging through some old piles, found this advertisement freebie given out at Supercon 2018. (This was handed out by one of the attendees and not part of the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/11/17/loot-at-supercon-the-goody-bag/">conference goody bag</a>.) The board already has all the surface mount pieces, I just need to solder the two through-hole components: the LED and the SAO header. It should be a short soldering project, might as well give it a shot.</p>

<p>With writing on both sides, I realized it wasn't obvious which side each component should be soldered to. Well, I wasn't going to use it as a badge SAO anyway, so it didn't really matter. I chose arbitrary directions.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with this "Qwiic" connector. It looks like something these guys are trying to promote as an interconnect for an <a href="https://github.com/ZIOCC">ecosystem of components</a>. I guess they saw <a href="http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/">Seeed Studio's Grove Connectors</a> and decided they had a better idea? This little giveaway didn't exactly entice me to dive in to their system, but it did let me know it existed and to look it over. I guess mission accomplished for this little freebie giveaway.</p>

<p>I used my bench power supply to deliver 3.3 volts to the input pins. The LED lit up and that's when I learned it was a fast color-changing LED. The lens is frosted instead of clear like the ones I've been using for fun, but the same basic idea.</p>
<p>It lights, it's fine.</p>
