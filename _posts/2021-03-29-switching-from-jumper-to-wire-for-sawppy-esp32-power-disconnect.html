<p>Micro servo <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/03/28/micro-servo-angular-position-inconsistency/">angle position inconsistency</a> probably won't damage a rover, but power problems will. When I decided to use an ESP32 dev module as the brain for my Micro Sawppy rovers, I did not anticipate that power would be a recurring headache in multiple contexts. One context is the fact that my rover has its own power source from a battery, and my computer has its own power source. The problem is that a ESP32 dev module's micro USB power would tie those two power planes together, and this is not a recipe for success. So I have to be careful to disconnect those two power sources every time I plug in a micro USB cable to update software. Because a computer's USB port will not have enough power to run a rover, and the rover's battery must not feed its power into a computer's USB port.</p>

<p>For my initial breadboard prototype, I took advantage of the solid core wires I used there to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/03/18/cardboard-box-rover-esp32-power-supply/" target="_blank">build a physical exclusion mechanism</a>. I couldn't quite carry that feature over to my current perforated prototype board with soldered connections. But I did solder in provision for a jumper to connect ESP32 power to rover battery, and I have to remember to remove this jumper before I plug in a micro USB cable.</p>

<p>To make this jumper more visible and more easily removed, I bought a pack of <a href="https://amzn.to/3ftvXiN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bright yellow jumper with tall pull tabs</a>. (*) This turned out to be not enough. The tab didn't really stand above the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/03/23/power-distribution-complicates-first-soldered-prototype-circuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nest of wires</a> on my prototype board, and it is even harder to access when the prototype board is placed inside my rover's body. The solution: two jumper wires. </p>

<p>Now I use two lengths of jumper wire, whose top connector rises far above the fray for me to easily access and, almost as importantly, easily seen. I could pull the wires apart for USB uploads, but this leaves a pin dangling about, carrying voltage that might cause problems if it touched anything. So I replaced the single position socket with a three-position socket, the far empty slot holding a connector crimped to no wire. This non-connected position allows me to store the pin when power is disconnected <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/03/30/micro-sawppy-beta-3-usb-access-port/">in order to use the micro USB port</a>.</p>
