<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17966" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neato-mini-usb-cable-connection-to-laptop.jpg" alt="Neato mini USB cable connection to laptop" width="1600" height="813">Now that I have some idea of what happens inside <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/neato_robot">ROS package <code>neato_robot</code></a>, and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/03/29/neato-robot-ros-package-expects-specific-response-but-responses-actually-differ-between-neato-units/">modified it</a> to (mostly) run on my Neato vacuum, I thought I'd look in its Github repository's list of issues to see if I understand what people have said about it. I didn't have to look very far: top of its open issues list is "<a href="https://github.com/mikeferguson/neato_robot/issues/8">Robot compatibility</a>."</p>
<p>The author agrees this is a good idea but it has to be done by someone with access to other Neato units, pull requests are welcome. <a href="https://github.com/mikeferguson/neato_robot/issues/8#issuecomment-76116227">This comment</a> was dated four years ago but my experience indicates no pull requests to improve compatibility were ever merged into this code.</p>
<p>But even though modifications were never merged back into this branch, they are still available. I just had to be pointed to know where to look. That comment thread referenced <a href="https://github.com/jlohse/neato_robot/commit/51ca2a5aab8ee8689a72b57f0593879c8cc85054">this particular commit</a> which eliminates those problematic fixed arrays of expected response strings. Now it will read a Neato's responses without trying to match it up against a preset list. Of course, if a specific response is still required (like <code>LeftWheel_PositionInMM</code> and <code>RightWheel_PositionInMM</code>) all it could do is ensure code will not hang, it is not capable of inferring requested data from other robot responses.</p>
<p>But possibly more interesting than code changes is this comment block:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>This driver reads responses until it receives a control-z. Neato Robotics has</code><br />
<code>documented that all responses have a control-Z (^Z) at the end of the</code><br />
<code>response string: http://www.neatorobotics.com.au/programmer-s-manual</code><br />
<code>CTRL_Z = chr(26)</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That URL implies it was a link to some type of a programmer's reference manual, but unfortunately that link is now dead. Still, this claim of control-Z termination (if true) gives me ideas on how I would approach talking to a Neato with my own code.</body></html></p>
