<img class=" size-medium wp-image-1942 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/onshape_logo_medium.png?w=600" alt="onshape_logo_medium" width="300" height="83">When getting started with 3D printing, it's easy enough to pull some nifty things from sites like <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse </a>and print them out. But I quickly got bored of that - the reason I got a 3D printer is to turn ideas in my head into reality, not somebody else's ideas.</p>
<p>There are lots of options to create digital 3D objects, the one I started with is <a href="https://www.onshape.com">Onshape</a>. It is a completely web-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">CAD</a> system with the ambition to take on the big professional engineering CAD systems. I chose it mainly because it ties into another of my interests: learning how web-based applications are replacing traditional desktop applications. CAD has been one of the cornerstones of expensive desktop machines crunching numbers as professional engineering workstations. Can Onshape (&amp; peers) transform that world? I don't know, but I want to see how well it works (or, potentially, not) first hand while having fun.</p>
<p>Fortunately they're very friendly to hobbyists like myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Their <a href="https://www.onshape.com/cad-pricing">subscription plan</a> has a free tier specifically for hobbyists and makers. The storage space is limited and you can only keep a few things private. So the scale and complexity of free projects are restricted, but all Onshape functionality is identical. This was important because a few other CAD solutions restrict functionality at the lower cost tiers... functionality such as export to STL. If I can't export to 3D print, that would defeat the point of the exercise.</li>
<li>There is an extensive <a href="https://www.onshape.com/learn-cad-online">self-training</a> resources section. A free service isn't much good if I have to fork out a fortune to learn how to use it. With Onshape, I don't have to.</li>
<li>There is an <a href="https://forum.onshape.com/">online community</a> around the tool. Onshape is new and still has quirks and idiosyncrasies. (Well, to be fair, all software do.) With the help of other like minded people on the forums, I don't have to reinvent the wheel and solve all problems by myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>After spending a few days in the training section, I was able to create simple things in Onshape. As I started getting fancier, I started running into problems that need digging into the documentation and/or the online forums. As I learn more about Onshape I'm increasingly impressed with what they've done and what they're planning to do.</p>
<p>It's a fun and functional tool. Highly recommended.</body></html></p>
