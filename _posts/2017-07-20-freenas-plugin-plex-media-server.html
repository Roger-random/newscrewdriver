For a fraction of the cost of a commercial solution like <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a>. Now we can start looking at the less critical fun stuff.</p>
<p>Part of my home media collection stored on my NAS includes various video files that I've been carrying around. Most of them were standard-definition video files I recorded off of broadcast television programs. This was done at a time when most people would record to VHS tape. Only the super nerdy types record to computer video.</p>
<p>So I had the files, but I didn't have a good way to play them straight off a file share. This is where something like <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex </a>comes in. There's a server-side component that runs on my FreeNAS box, talking to client-side components for various devices. The web client could cast to a Google Chromecast, and the Amazon Fire TV stick has a Plex client app.</p>
<p>For security isolation, FreeNAS runs plugins inside a "jail". This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail">FreeBSD feature </a>that sounds a lot like a Docker container but isn't a Docker container. This isolation is good default security, but it does mean the Plex Media Server plugin could not see the rest of the FreeNAS box until the user specifies a way for the code inside the jail to see specifically allowed files outside of a jail. I could even specify the storage visibility to be read-only so there would be no accidental manipulation of my video files.</p>
<p>Once I got past the FreeBSD jail mechanics, it was mostly smooth sailing. The only problem came from the large fraction of my files encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Video">Windows Media Video</a> format, an old video format that Plex does not support. If I end up deciding I like the Plex experience, I will have to look into doing a bulk re-encode of these old video files.</body></html></p>
