<p>A few years ago Github courted the 3D printing crowd by offering a 3D model viewer to see STL files, and then added a feature to <a href="https://blog.github.com/2013-09-17-3d-file-diffs/">visualize differences between revisions of STL files</a>.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-16508 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/039e6170-1c8b-11e3-8020-b3157840fcf6.gif" alt="039e6170-1c8b-11e3-8020-b3157840fcf6" width="609" height="361"></p>
<p>One of the reasons I put <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/Sawppy_Rover/tree/master/STL">Sawppy STLs on Github</a> is for people to see parts in their browser without having to install any software. I thought it would also be cool for people to see parts as they evolved. When I first started playing with putting STL files on Github, I thought this was a great way to track changes across major revisions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the revision visualization module seems to be gone. The 3D model viewer is still there so the primary motivation for putting STLs on Github is still good. But when I try to view file changes, the changes are no longer shown. The <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/3d-file-viewer/">official help documentation</a> still talks about the feature, it just doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>I liked seeing STL diffs visually and it makes me sad the feature is now inaccessible.</p>
