<p>For years I've been trying to figure out how to do machine vision affordably so I could build autonomous robots. I looked at hacking <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/08/23/observations-from-a-neato-lidar-on-the-move/">cheap LIDAR from a Neato robot vacuum</a>. I looked at an <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/24/xbox-360-kinect-depth-sensor-data-via-openkinect-freenect/">old Kinect sensor bar</a>. I looked at <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/18/sawppy-the-rovers-mast-cameras/">Google AIY Vision</a>. I looked at <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/02/15/window-shopping-jevois-machine-vision-camera/">JeVois</a>. I tried to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/27/trying-opencv-getting-started-guide-by-pyimagesearch/">get a grounding in OpenCV</a>. And I was in the middle of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/07/14/first-glance-at-google-arcore-depth-map/">getting up to speed on Google ARCore</a> when the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/27/trying-opencv-getting-started-guide-by-pyimagesearch/">OpenCV AI Kit (OAK) Kickstarter</a> launched.</p>
<p>Like most Kickstarters, the product description is written to make it sound like a fantastic dream come true. The difference between this and every other Kickstarter is that it is describing <em><strong>my</strong></em> dream of an affordable robot vision sensor coming true.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter is launching two related products. The first is OAK-1, a single camera backed by hardware acceleration for computer vision algorithms. This sounds like a supercharged competitor to machine vision cameras like the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/02/15/window-shopping-jevois-machine-vision-camera/">JeVois</a> and <a href="https://openmv.io/">OpenMV</a>. However, it is less relevant to a mobile autonomous robot than its stablemate, the OAK-D.</p>
<p>Armed with two cameras for stereoscopic vision plus a third for full color high resolution image capture, the OAK-D promises a tremendous amount of capability for (at least the current batch of backers) a relatively affordable $149. Both from relatively straightforward stereo distance calculations to more sophisticated inferences (like image segmentation) aided by that distance information.</p>
<p>Relatively to the $99 Google AIY Vision, the OAK-D has far more promise for helping a robot understand the structure of its environment. I hope it ships and delivers on all its promises, because then an OAK-D would become the camera of choice for autonomous robot projects, hands down. But even if not, it is still a way to capture stereo footage for calculation elsewhere, and only moderately overpriced for a three-camera peripheral. Or at least, that's how I justified backing an OAK-D for my own experiments. The project has easily surpassed its funding goals, so now I have to wait and see if the team can deliver the product by December 2020 as promised.</p>
