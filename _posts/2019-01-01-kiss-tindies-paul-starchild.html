<p>With art reference in hand, printed to match scale with my KISS Tindie PCB heads, it's time to start bending wire for my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/31/kiss-tindies-a-wire-form-practice-project/">KISS Tindies project</a>! I started with the face in the upper-left corner of the PCB, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)#Make-up_designs">Wikipedia told me</a> represented "The Starchild" by Paul Stanley. The first wire I bent was for his right arm, but as I looked at my reference drawing I realized the critical part of this whole project would come down to whether I can make the guitar work in copper wire.</p>
<p>So I started on the guitar next. Bending wire to mimic features on my reference art. There were a lot of details on this guitar and, after thinking over how much time I wanted to spend on this project, I decided to skip out on those fine details. My copper wire curves will represent just the major character lines.</p>

<p>So the next question for project go/no-go is whether a simplified version of the art would look good enough to proceed. The guitar curves were painstakingly retracing in copper wire, and I decided the results were good enough to continue.</p>

<p>Here's my simplified version of Paul's Starchild rendered in copper wire. I think the important parts have been sufficiently represented, and I can always come back later to solder in more details if I wanted. This is encouraging enough of a result for me to proceed with the rest of the band.</p>
