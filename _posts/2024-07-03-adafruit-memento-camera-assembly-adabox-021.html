<p>I'm having fun learning Adafruit's CircuitPython, alternating between beginner-friendly tutorials and diving into more advanced topics <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/07/02/usb-devices-in-circuitpython/">like USB endpoints</a>. Next step is popping back into tutorial world as I open my <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/adabox021">Adabox 021</a>.</p>

<p>This was my first <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/adabox">Adabox</a>. I started my subscription sometime during the pandemic hoping for a nice distraction but global supply chain issues meant Adafruit had to put the program on hold. Subscribers are not charged until a box ships, so the hold didn't cost me any money, it just meant I didn't get the distraction I wanted. Finally the program resumed with Spring 2024's Adabox 021 and I like what I saw when I opened the box. Everything was wrapped up with a nice presentation, like a gift box.</p>

<p>The core of Adabox 021 is their Memento camera board, which can be <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5420">purchased on its own</a> but subscribers get several accessories to go with the board. Like face plates front and back to protect fragile electronics on the main camera board. I was amused by the fact fun photography-related quotes have been placed on inner surfaces where they can be read during assembly but hidden out of sight once assembled.</p>

<p>I followed <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adabox021/memento-assembly">assembly instructions</a> and everything came together smoothly. But the camera couldn't take any pictures. A bit of troubleshooting pointed to the bundled 256MB microSD card as my problem. When I swapped it out with a 4GB microSD card I had on hand, the camera started working. My computer couldn't read the 256MB card either. So I followed "<em><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-memento-camera-board/formatting-notes">microSD Card Formatting Notes</a></em>" and used SD association's formatting utility on the 256MB card, which seemed to run as expected. After formatting I could use my PC to write a text file to the card and, once ejected and re-inserted, read the text. But if I then put that card into Memento, it would not be recognized by Memento as a valid storage device. And after that, my PC could no longer read the card, either, and I have to format it again. Something's weird here <a href="https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=209419">and I'm not alone</a> but since I had a 4GB card that worked, I'm not going to worry too much about it. It's much more interesting to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/07/04/adafruit-memento-camera-hardware/">start examining details of this device</a>.</p>
