<p>Something didn't go according to plan with my latest project and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/03/03/mp1584-modification-did-not-go-as-planned/">destroyed a few components</a>. The prime suspect is my recent modification to a MP1584 buck converter modules I bought on Amazon. By default, it would activate if input voltage is over 3V. This is far too low to deliver 3.3V output, so I modified it to defer activation until input voltage is nearly 12 Volts. A simple test with volt meter and simple LED was successful, but when I connected the ESP8266 microcontroller and INA219 sensor I released the magic smoke.</p>

<p>Before I connected those components I had checked the voltage output and it looked fine on a volt meter so I suspect there's something with a transition behavior. This calls for an oscilloscope and I have a cheap DSO 138 that is better than nothing. Since the time <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/01/22/dso-138-oscilloscope-kit-by-jye-tech/" target="_blank">I bought the kit and put it together</a>, something has gone wrong with its voltage reference and now absolute voltage readings are unreliable. However, I think the relative shape of the waveform still resembled reality.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I first checked typical startup behavior: what does the 3.3V output look like when I connect this modified buck converter to 13V input? I set the oscilloscope to hold data upon rising edge trigger, and captured this:</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The shape looks reasonable. It corresponds to graph in the MP1584 datasheet and shows the advertised soft-start capability to avoid a voltage overshoot on startup, which was my first suspect. I then turned the oscilloscope to continuous scan mode and adjusted my power supply voltage up and down. When I stay well above the input enable voltage of ~11.8V everything looks good, the buck converter maintained a steady 3.3V output. (It reads 5.27V on the display due to the voltage reference weirdness I spoke of.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But things started looking dicey as I dropped close to 12V. I started seeing a sawtooth pattern to the output voltage. Instead of holding at 3.3V, I started seeing the voltage drop then jump upwards, with the magnitude growing wider and wider as I dropped input voltage. The worst was when I dropped into range below the 11.8V activation voltage, but still staying above the shutdown voltage...</p>

<p>Without accurate voltage reference I don't know exactly how many volts it whipped through, but at a guess it looks like it dips just below 2V before overshooting above 4V. This would definitely destroy components designed for 3.3V. It's great that I see <em>what</em> is happening, now I need to think about <em>why</em> it happens and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/03/05/potential-explanations-for-mp1584-behavior/">decide what I will do about it</a>.</p>
