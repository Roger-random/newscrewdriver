<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16622" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/tensorflow-logo.jpg?w=150" alt="TensorFlow Logo" width="150" height="150">Being on the leading edge carries its own kind of thrill. When I started looking over the TurtleBot 3 manual I noticed the index listed a "<a href="http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/machine_learning/#machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>" chapter. As I read through all the sections in order, I was looking forward to that chapter. Sadly I was greatly disappointed when I reached that chapter and saw it was a placeholder with "Coming Soon!"</p>
<p>I didn't know how soon that "soon" was going to be, but I did not expect it to be a matter of days. But when I went back to flip through the material today I was surprised to see it's no longer a placeholder. The chapter got some minimal content within the past few days, as confirmed by <a href="https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/emanual/commits/master/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/machine_learning.md">Github history</a> of that page. Nice! This is definitely a strength of an online electronic manual versus a printed one.</p>
<p>So it's no longer "Coming Soon!" but it is also by no means complete. Or at least, the user is already assumed to understand machine learning via DQN algorithms. Since I put off my own TensorFlow explorations to look at ROS, I have no idea what that means or how I might tweak the parameters to improve results. This page looks especially barren when compared to the <a href="http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/slam">mapping section</a>, where the manual had far more information on how the algorithm's parameters can be modified.</p>
<p>Maybe they have plans to return a flesh it out some more in the future, which would be helpful. Alternatively, it's possible that once I put some time into learning TensorFlow I will know exactly what's going on with this page. But right now that's not the case.</p>
<p>Still, it's encouraging to know that there are documented ways to use TensorFlow machine learning algorithms in the context of driving a robot via ROS. I look forward to the day when I know enough to compose all these pieces together to build intelligent robots.</body></html></p>
