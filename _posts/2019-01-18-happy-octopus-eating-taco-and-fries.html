<p>As a short break from larger scale projects, I decided to get some more SMD soldering practice. When I was at Supercon I received these little soldering kits which were designed to the simple "<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/52950-shitty-add-ons">Shitty Add-On</a>" specification. It's a way for people to get a simple start with PCB projects made with aesthetics in mind as well as functionality, headlined by <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/09/05/all-the-badges-of-def-con-26-vol-4/">sophisticated #badgelife creations</a>.</p>
<p>As fitting their simple nature, all I have to start with are little zip lock bags of parts. The first hint towards assembly instructions were printed on the circuit board: the text @Michelle4904 which pointed to the <a href="https://twitter.com/michelle4904">Twitter page of Michelle Grau</a> and a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MZ-Gf56ivJ_pZaOBdA2XsJtWuKzQMPqqDXrGzq-pdRY">Google Doc of assembly instructions</a>. One notable fact of these kits is that there were no extra parts to replace any that might accidentally fly off into space, which meant I had to be extra careful handling them. Fortunately, the parts were larger than my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/26/freeform-fun-with-salvaged-smd-leds/">most recent SMD LED project</a> and while I did drop a few, these were large enough they did not fly too far and I was able to recover them.</p>
<p>I started with the fries. It was slow going at first because I was very afraid of losing parts. But I gradually built up a feel for handling them and things got gradually faster. After a bit of experimentation, I settled on a pattern of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tin one pad with a small blob of solder.</li>
<li>Place the SMD component next to the blob, and melt the blob again to connect them.</li>
<li>Solder the other end of SMD component to other pad.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the rapid start portion of the learning curve - every LED felt faster and easier than the last. Soon the pack of fries were finished and illuminated. I was a little confused as to why the five LEDs were green, I had expected them to be yellow. Maybe they are seasoned fries with parsley or something?</p>
<p>Tangential note: when I visit Red Robin I like to upgrade to their <a href="https://www.redrobin.com/menu/sides-and-subs/garlic-herbed-fries.html">garlic herbed fries</a>.</p>

<p>Once the fries were done, I then moved on to the taco which had a denser arrangement of components. It was an appropriate next step up in difficulty.</p>

<p>Once completed, I have a taco with yellow LEDs for the shell (the same yellow I would have expected in the fries...), red LED for tomato, green LED for lettuce, and white LED for sour cream. It's a fun little project.</p>
<p>Tangential note: <a href="http://ixtaco.com/">Ixtaco Taqueria</a> is my favorite taco place in my neighborhood.</p>

<p>The last zip lock bag has a smiling octopus and it was the easiest one to solder. It appears the original intention was to be an 1-to-4 expansion board for shitty add-ons, but if so, the connector genders are backwards.</p>

<p>No matter, I'll just solder the taco and fries permanently to my happy octopus tentacles. In order to let this assembly of PCBs stand on its own, I soldered one of the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/06/kiss-tindie-battery-power/">battery holders I designed for my KISS Tindies</a>.</p>

<p>And here's a happy octopus enjoying Taco Tuesday and a side of fries.</p>
