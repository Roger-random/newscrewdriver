<p>The previous post outlined a relatively minimal path to getting a virtual robot up and running in the <a href="http://gazebosim.org/">Gazebo simulation environment</a>. The robot is a virtual copy of the physical TurtleBot 3 Burger, and they both run code built on ROS. This setup should be pretty close to a ROS "Hello World" for a beginner like myself to get started poking at and learning what's going on.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to run <code>rostopic list</code>. As per <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics">tutorial on ROS topics</a>, this is a tool to see all the information topics being published by all components running under a ROS core.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>/clicked_point</code><br />
<code>/clock</code><br />
<code>/cmd_vel</code><br />
<code>/gazebo/link_states</code><br />
<code>/gazebo/model_states</code><br />
<code>/gazebo/parameter_descriptions</code><br />
<code>/gazebo/parameter_updates</code><br />
<code>/gazebo/set_link_state</code><br />
<code>/gazebo/set_model_state</code><br />
<code>/gazebo_gui/parameter_descriptions</code><br />
<code>/gazebo_gui/parameter_updates</code><br />
<code>/imu</code><br />
<code>/initialpose</code><br />
<code>/joint_states</code><br />
<code>/move_base_simple/goal</code><br />
<code>/odom</code><br />
<code>/rosout</code><br />
<code>/rosout_agg</code><br />
<code>/scan</code><br />
<code>/statistics</code><br />
<code>/tf</code><br />
<code>/tf_static</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That's a pretty long list of topics, which might seem intimidating at first glance until we realize just because it's available doesn't mean it's being used.</p>
<p>How do we look at what's actually in use? Again from the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics">ROS topics tutorial</a>, we can use a ROS utility that graphs out all active nodes <em><strong>and</strong></em> the topics they are using to talk to each other. <code>rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph</code></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16589" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/random-walk-rqt_graph.png" alt="random walk rqt_graph.png" width="1112" height="621"></p>
<p>Ah, good. Only a few things are active. And this was only when we have everything running as listed at the end of the previous post, which were:</p>
<ol>
<li>TurtleBot in Gazebo</li>
<li>TurtleBot performing a random walk with collision avoidance</li>
<li>Rviz to plot laser range-finder data.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we stop Rvis, the <code>/robot_state_publisher</code> node disappears, so that was used exclusively for visualization. The two nodes prefixed with <code>gazebo</code> are pretty obviously interface points to the simulator, leaving <code>/turtlebot3_drive</code> as the node corresponding to the random walk algorithm.</p>
<p>The velocity command topic <code>/cmd_vel</code> looks just like the one in the basic <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim">turtlesim</a> used in the ROS tutorial, and I infer it is a standardized way to command robot movement in ROS components. The <code>/scan</code> topic must then be the laser rangefinder data used for collision avoidance.</p>
<p>To find the source code behind item #2, the obvious starting point is the command line used to start it: <code>roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch</code>. This tells us the code lives in the <code>turtlebot3_gazebo</code> module and we can look at the launch instructions by giving the same parameters to the ROS edit command. <code>rosed turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch</code>. This brings up a XML file that described components for the random walk. From here I can see the node comes from something called "<code>turtlebot3_drive</code>".</p>
<p>I found a <code>turtlebot3_drive.cpp</code> in the source code tree by brute force. I'm sure there was a better way to trace it from the <code>.launch</code> file to the <code>.cpp</code>, I just don't know it yet. Maybe I'll figure that out later, but for now I have a chunk of ROS C++ that I can tinker with.</p>
