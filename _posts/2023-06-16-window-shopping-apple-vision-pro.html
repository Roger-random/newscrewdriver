<p>I've had a lot of fun the past few years exploring virtual realities and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/15/some-of-my-virtual-reality-favorites/">I have my favorites</a>. While researching buying a new headset I came across rumors that Apple might be entering this space. Those rumors have recently proven to be true and announced as <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Vision Pro</a>. As is typical of Apple, they are focused on doing their own thing. In this initial set of announcements and carefully chaperoned press experiences, there has been no overlap between Vision Pro capabilities and any of the VR experiences I've enjoyed so far. In fact, out of all the press about this new thing, the one I found most informative is a CNet piece about what <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-vision-pros-biggest-missing-pieces/">Apple has not expressed interest in doing with the Vision Pro</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What has been disclosed about Vision Pro hardware is extremely impressive, following many examples of Apple's past hardware innovations. It was not a surprise the company that touted "Retina Display" would give us high resolution displays covering a wide field of view. Apple silicon's power/performance leadership should easily outpace Oculus Quest while still maintaining power efficiency superior to PC hardware. And their Airpod experience should help engineer high quality integrated audio.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What I did not expect was the extensive sensor array built into the device highlighted in this image from Apple. The advertisement pitch is "<em>precise head and hand tracking and real-time 3D mapping</em>". I expected some variation of the iPad Pro LIDAR scanner for Apple's ARKit type capability, but Vision Pro goes far beyond baseline ARKit type functionality. I suspect there's some headroom built-in for developers to explore usage scenarios Apple hasn't even thought of yet. If some of these capabilities don't pan out, they can be trimmed back in a hypothetical future affordable Vision non-Pro model.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Apple has clearly thought of a lot, though. One peripheral not mentioned is any type of handheld controller. All the hype is about how that sensor array can precisely track the user's hands. Our eyes come into this as well, with gaze tracking inside the headset. Combining these capabilities, Apple has designed their own of interaction semantics free of handheld controllers. I'd be curious how well this works outside of Apple's carefully curated introductory experience.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>One design detail I appreciated was Vision Pro doesn't try to accommodate eyeglasses. Every other VR/AR headset had to be larger and bulkier than they strictly needed to be, just so they can enclose a large space around potential eyeglasses worn by the user. For people without perfect vision (or unwilling to wear contact lenses) using Vision Pro means an additional financial commitment of buying lenses matching their prescription for installation inside the Vision Pro. Unfortunately, this also means I'm unlikely to get a quick trial experience of somebody else's headset <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/05/my-virtual-reality-a-ha-moment/">like I got with the Oculus DK2</a>. I would have to find someone (1) willing to let me try their expensive Vision Pro, (2) have vision prescription close to mine, and (3) have similar spacing between their eyes. Not impossible, but I'm not counting on it.</p>

<p>Seeing how Apple's Vision Pro doesn't even try to compete directly against existing products, I'm happy to see Apple continuing to do their "Think Different" thing trying out new ideas. I eagerly await more information once Vision Pro gets in the hands of actual users and away from scripted Apple chaperones. That'll give us a much better idea whether it is the initial groundbreaking product of a new category or a noble but ultimately doomed experiment. It wouldn't be the first time <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/17/lenovo-mirage-ar-was-a-huge-disappointment/">an AR product ended in disappointment</a>.</p>
