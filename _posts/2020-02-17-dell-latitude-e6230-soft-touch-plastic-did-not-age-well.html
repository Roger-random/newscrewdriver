<p>When I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/15/refurbished-dell-latitude-e6230-first-impressions/">looked over the exterior</a> of my refurbished Dell Latitude E6230 laptop, I noticedÂ  some common touch parts of the wrist rest and touch pad had been covered with stickers. They were very well done on my example. It took me a while to realized they were even there. In use, they were not bothersome.</p>
<p>Initially I thought they were there to cover up signs of wear and tear on this refurbished machine, but I've realized there's an additional and possibly more important reason for the sticker: The plastic material for the wrist rest has degraded.</p>
<p>Usually when plastic degrades it hardens or discolors, but for certain types of plastic, the breakdown results in a sticky surface that is unpleasant to touch. I usually see this in the flexible plastic shroud for old cables and not in rigid installations like a keyboard wrist rest. I assume these machines were originally built with some type of soft touch plastic which degraded in this very unpleasant manner.</p>
<p>I wonder what the production story behind this laptop is. I can think of a few possibilities right away and I'm sure there are more:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dell did not perform long term testing on this material and didn't know it would degrade this way.</li>
<li>Dell performed testing, but the methodology for accelerated aging didn't trigger this behavior, so it didn't show up in the tests.</li>
<li>Dell was aware of this behavior, believed it would not occur until well after warranty period, and thus not their problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>The expensive way to solve this problem would be to re-cast the plastic wrist rest in a different material and replace the part. Covering just the important surfaces with stickers is an ingeniously inexpensive workaround. Once the stickers were installed, I wouldn't have to touch the unpleasant surfaces in normal use. However, there are still some sections exposed around the keyboard, and the sticky material is now a dust magnet.</p>
<p>It is a flaw in this little capable machine, but one I can tolerate thanks to the stickers. It made the laptop cheap to buy refurbished, and I'll be less reluctant to take the computer apart and embed it in a robot, which is one of the long term plans for this machine.</body></html></p>
