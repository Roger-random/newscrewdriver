<p>Whenever I turn on my Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet, I immediately hear motors whirring and I had always been curious: I haven't even tried to print anything yet. What is it doing? Now that I've retired the machine and slowly taking it apart, I want to get some information hopefully leading to some answers. I have attached an Arduino Nano to two photo interrupter sensors and the quadrature encoder reporting position of the paper feed motor gearbox assembly. The Nano <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/02/02/quadrature-decoding-with-periodic-output/">watches those sensors and report on their status every 10 milliseconds</a> to a serial port as a list of comma-separated values. Thanks to the "everything is a file" nature of Linux, I could run "<code>cat /dev/ttyUSB0 &gt; capture.csv</code>" and I had a file I could import into Excel.</p>

<p>Here is the startup sequence that has long intrigued me, in the form of an Excel scatter chart. Horizontal axis is the time stamp. This graph covered about 9 seconds with a data point every 10ms, resulting in dots densely packed into a line. Vertical axis is the encoder counter value, with the encoder as a gray line maxing out at almost 32000 counts. (Getting a number for count per rotation is on the to-do list.)</p>

<p>The two photo interrupter sensors did not change state throughout startup.</p>

<p>Due to the way I wired up the quadrature decoder, positive values on on this counter correspond to rotating the paper feed backwards. I usually think of printing as advancing forwards on the Y-axis, so this is reversed from that I would have chosen if I had known. But now that it is connected, I don't care enough to fix this minor issue. If it starts causing problems I can flip the two wires and reverse their direction.</p>

<p>The fact this plot appears to be a series of straight lines tells me the motor does not vary its speed (significantly) once it is in motion.</p>

<p>Zooming on the initial set of movements, I see an acceleration curve before it reaches that speed, and there's a deceleration curve at the end of each movement. My eyes did not perceive acceleration and deceleration, so this exercise is already telling me things I couldn't pick up with my own eyes. I can also see the first two movements here are both backwards, but the second movement has a gentler slope reflecting a slower speed. Another difference I could not see with eyeballs.</p>

<p>Zooming in on a different part of the graph, this is the point of maximum backwards travel. On the big graph I saw a small bump on either side of the peak, now I seeâ€‚the motor decelerated to a stop before immediately accelerating back up in the same direction, only to decelerate to a stop again before going in the opposite direction. It then slowed down again to a stop before resuming in the same direction at a different speed. Both of these pauses are extremely short, only a few milliseconds if that.</p>

<p>What did that motion accomplish? In fact, what did any of these motions accomplish? I don't have answers yet, but I'm excited I'm peeling back at least the first layer of this onion.
