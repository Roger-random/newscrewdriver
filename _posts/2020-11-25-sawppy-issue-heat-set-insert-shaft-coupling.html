<p>Looking at what other Sawppy builders have done to customize their own rovers, I learned that ground clearance <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/23/sawppy-rover-ground-clearance/">isn't as valued as I thought it would be</a>. At first I was disappointed, because giving Sawppy great ground clearance took a lot of hard work. But then I decided to look on the positive side, because this feedback also meant I could trade off some clearance for other features and not have it be considered an instant fail.</p>

<p>Another common theme of feedback on Sawppy wheels concern shaft coupling and heat-set inserts. It has been a perpetual problem for me, to the point where I started <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/03/23/sawppy-field-repair-unit-servo-coupler/" target="_blank">preparing field replacement units</a> of shaft couplers. I also heard from other Sawppy builders that it has been problematic for them as well.</p>

<p>The biggest problem was caused by my ignorance: I thought all M3 inserts would be the same size, but I was wrong. Inside, yes, but not outside. Furthermore, optimal heat set inserts usage require hole diameter within a pretty narrow range. And that range appears to be narrower than the range of variation between 3D printers. All this meant my Sawppy design printed as-is would frequently not work for another rover builder and require modification. Either their insert is a different diameter, or their printer would print differently, or some combination of both.</p>

<p>Some builders applied their creativity to this problem and came up with alternate approaches. Chris Bond went with the direct approach: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bondrobotics.com/sawppy/" target="_blank">drilling and tapping a hole through the diameter of the shaft</a>. This is a good option if a vise and drill press is available, but drilling on a round shape is very challenging with handheld tools.</p>

<p>TeamSG for Aussie Sawppy explored another route: instead of round shafts, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackaday.io/project/166017-aussie-sawppy/log/176341-aussie-sawppy-hex-drive" target="_blank">use hex profile shafts</a>. I knew precision shaped profile beams of metal are expensive and difficult to get, so I didn't think it was a good idea. But TeamSG thought of something I did not: Hex profile wrenches are plentiful, precise, and made of strong metals. Cutting up a few is a brilliant approach to build some rover hex drives!</p>

<p>Laura McKeegan's CJ rover offered yet another approach: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackaday.io/project/165094-cj-a-sawppy-variant/log/164835-some-modifications-from-the-original-sawppy-parts" target="_blank">use captive hex nuts</a> which worked when heat-set inserts did not. Unlike heat-set inserts, M3 hex nuts <em>are</em> standardized with an external diameter of 5.5mm from flat to flat.</p>

<p>My own experiments with captive nuts have not been successful, because if I put too much force my nuts will start spinning inside their slot. To fix this, I would heat it up with my soldering iron and turn it into a crude heat-set insert. So I thought I'd just go straight to heat-set inserts. But given feedback from builders and knowing what I know now about non-uniformity of M3 heat set inserts, I think captive nuts might be worth another look.</p>

<p>And while I'm working on solutions for Sawppy's shaft coupler problems, it's worth noting that the shaft themselves <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/26/sawppy-issue-getting-e-clip-slots-right-is-hard/">have been problematic as well</a>.</p>
