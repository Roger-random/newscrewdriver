<p>I received a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-hallowing">Adafruit Hallowing</a> in the Supercon sponsor gift bag given to attendees. While reading up about it, I came across this line that made no sense to me at the time.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>OK so technically it's more like a really tricked-out Feather than a Wing but we simply could not resist the Hallowing pun.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-17251 alignright" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-logo.png" alt="feather-logo" width="301" height="148"></p>
<p>I can tell the words "Feather" and "Wing" has some meaning in this context that is different from their plain English meaning, but I didn't know what they were talking about.</p>
<p>But since this is Adafruit, I knew somewhere on their site is an explanation that breaks down whats going on in detail. I just had to follow the right links to get there. My expectations were fully met - and then some - when I found <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather">this link</a>.</p>
<p>So now I understand this is a counterpart to the other electronics hobbyist programming boards and their standardized expansion board form factor. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi foundation</a> defines their <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-raspberry-pi-hats/">HAT</a>, <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> defines their <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoShields">Shield</a>, and now Adafruit gets into the game with feathers (a board with brains) and wings (accessories to add on a feather.)</p>
<p>Except unlike Raspberry Pi or Arduino, a feather isn't fixed to a particular architecture, or a particular chip. As long as they operate on 3.3 volts and can communicate with the usual protocols (I2C, SPI), they can be made into a feather. Adafruit make <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/946">feathers out of all the popular microcontrollers</a>. Not just the SAM D21 at the heart of Hallowing, but also other chips of the ATmega line as well as recent darling ESP32.</p>
<p>Similarly, anyone is welcome to create a wing that could be attached to a feather. As long as they follow guidelines on footprint and pin assignment, it can <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/945">fit right into the wings ecosystem</a>. Something for me to keep in mind if I ever get into another KiCad project in the future - I can build it as a wing!</p>
