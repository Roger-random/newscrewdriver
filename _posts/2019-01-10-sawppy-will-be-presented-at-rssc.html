<p>I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/02/sawppy-at-dtla-mini-maker-faire/">brought Sawppy to the Downtown Los Angeles Mini Maker Faire</a> this past December, where I had the opportunity to give a short presentation about my project. (Above.) Also at the event were the <a href="https://www.rssc.org/">Robotics Society of Southern California (RSSC)</a> and a few members asked if I would be interested in presenting Sawppy at an upcoming RSSC meeting.</p>
<p>Since I'm always happy to share Sawppy with anyone interested in my little rover, I said yes and I'm on their calendar for the RSSC meeting on Saturday, January 12th. From 11AM to noon, I plan to talk for about 35-40 minutes and leave the remaining time for Q&amp;A and drive Sawppy over obstacles to demonstrate the rocker-bogie suspension.</p>
<p>This group has collective expertise in <a href="http://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System</a>, which I've been <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/software-tools/ros/">learning on-and-off at a self guided pace</a>. If conversations go in a direction where it makes sense, I'll be asking my audience for their input on how to best put Sawppy on ROS. I also plan to bring <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/projects/phoebe-turtlebot/">Phoebe</a>, my ROS TurtleBot clone that I built to learn ROS, just for fun.</p>
<p>And I'm sure I'll see other cool robotics projects there!</p>
