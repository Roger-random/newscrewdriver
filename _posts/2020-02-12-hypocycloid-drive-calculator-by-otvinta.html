<p>The best part of maker/hacker gatherings is the opportunity to meet and chat with people who introduce me to ideas and resources. At Sparklecon 2020 I met Allen Phuong who saw Sawppy roaming around and wanted to learn more. Sadly he had missed <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/01/26/sparklecon-2020-sawppys-first-day/">my Sawppy presentation</a> because he was busy participating in the battle bot competition taking place at the same time, but I gave him an abbreviated version and we talked about many projects on our respective to-do lists, robotic and more.</p>
<p>Allen got me interested in hypocycloid gears again. It was something I briefly examined while looking for ways to build a gearbox to obtain low speed and high torque but without the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(engineering)">backlash present in typical gearboxes</a>. Right now the standard solution in robotics is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_drive">harmonic drive</a>, which is an expensive solution that has specific requirements on the material used to build the flexible spline. 3D printer plastic does not meet all the requirements and hence 3D-printed harmonic drives always involve trade-offs that made me less interested.</p>
<p>Cycloidal drives do not have a flexible component with strict material behavior requirements, all parts remain rigid while in operation. For (near) zero backlash operation, however, it requires high dimensional accuracy. I dismissed it for this reason as 3D printing is not very precise. However, Allen asserted that 3D printers can reach the required levels so maybe it's worth a second look. And even if I can't get my 3D printer to meet my dimensional accuracy goals, I now have access to a few tools that I didn't have before. Ranging from a laser cutter, to my project CNC mill, to a resin printer. All capable of far higher accuracy than my 3D printer.</p>
<p>There are a few tools available online to help generate profiles based on parameters I specify. Allen pointed me to the <a href="http://www.otvinta.com/cycloid.html">Hypocycloid Gear Calculator on Otvinta</a>, which looks like a worthwhile starting point. The author of this site has decided to focus on Blender as the 3D tool, so if I want to make use of the results, I'll have to learn how to translate it into Onshape or Fusion 360. But first, I can get a taste <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/13/otvinta-3d-printed-hypocycloid-drive-model/">via a ready-made project</a>.</p>
