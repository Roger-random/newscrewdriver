Here are some thoughts and updates on a few items I mentioned in the "Round 1" post:</p>
<p><strong>Constraints</strong>: Onshape has very good constraint notification and management. I know exactly when dimensions are fully constrained, and when things are over-constrained, I can see where the conflicts are. In the current default configuration for Autodesk Fusion 360, none of that is available.</p>
<p>However, if one goes into the Preferences menu and go to the feature preview section, there's an option to turn on the work-in-progress support for constraint notification. This feature, while far from parity with Onshape's excellent design, goes a long way to easing the pain.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-4542 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/a360-preview.jpg" alt="A360 Preview" width="869" height="548"></p>
<p>The complaint about over-constrained situation still applies: an error box is still all we get without any further details. But at least we get a color change to notify us when a feature is fully constrained, even if it isn't completely reliable yet. Sometimes a feature's color changes even though it hasn't been fully constrained, and sometimes a color doesn't change even when fully constrained. I am still occasionally surprised by how features would move unexpectedly later on in the workflow. Still, it is far better than nothing.</p>
<p><em>Advantage</em>: Still Onshape, but by a much thinner margin.</p>

<p><strong><img class=" size-full wp-image-4547 alignright" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/share-design-public.png" alt="Share Design Public" width="364" height="278">Sharing:</strong> I was unhappy with the complex access control system, making it difficult to just share a design to everybody. But they have since added (or I just noticed) an option on every design in the project navigation tab: "Share Public Link". It will generate a link to share publicly. This one is actually a step above Onshape, where I can choose whether the sharing link is a snapshot or a live link to the current state. Choose whether the design itself is downloadable.</p>
<p>And best of all, the design is visible without creating an Autodesk account. Unlike Onshape, where people have to have an Onshape account to access public documents.</p>
<p><em>Advantage</em>: Fusion 360 takes the lead from Onshape because no account creation is required.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Offline:</strong> And now, a sour note. Since Fusion 360 is a native application, with an option to "Work Offline", I had fully expected it to continue functioning when my internet connection failed. Unfortunately this was not the case! It appears that one needs to be online to enable offline work. I guess they need to download some information before the application can function offline. This make sense when the scenario is to prepare in the office before taking a computer on the road. But when the internet connection is unexpectedly severed, such preparation stage is not possible and things grind to a halt.</p>
<p><em>Advantage</em>: Nobody. Inopportune network outage renders both useless.</body></html></p>
