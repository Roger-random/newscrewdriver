<p>While I'm making my way learning how to write proper modules for Robot Operating System, the rest of my SGVHAK compatriots have not been twiddling their thumbs waiting. Just like I went and built Sawppy as my idea of a cool rover project, Dave designed and built Mr. Blue as his idea of a cool rover.</p>
<p>All the blue printed plastic parts (which gave this rover its name) was designed in Dave's preferred CAD software <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>. These pieces connect thin wall aluminum tubing that is very strong yet quite affordable. Making this rover a great exploration into a construction method quite different from Sawppy, where I designed 3D-printed plastic components in Onshape CAD and they connected Misumi <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/05/08/how-to-build-anything-out-of-aluminum-extrusion-and-3d-printed-brackets/">aluminum extrusion beams</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Blue also expresses Dave's ability to design and build electronics circuits. Where my Sawppy used <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/07/05/wrangling-rc-servos-becoming-a-hassle-try-serial-bus-servos/">serial bus servos</a>, Dave has custom controller boards driving all the motors. There are two types on board: one drives a DC motor with feedback provided by optical quadrature encoders, the other drives a commodity servo motor but with precise position feedback via high-resolution magnetic encoders. In both cases, they feed into a 3D-printed gearbox for additional mechanical reduction.</p>
<p>Originally, the plan was to get Mr. Blue up and running on ROS, but Dave's progress at construction was faster than my progress at learning ROS. As an interim solution, I added support for Dave's motor control boards to my <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/SGVHAK_Rover">SGVHAK Rover software project</a>. Now we have the same basic software running three rovers built with three different motor systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>SGVHAK Rover is running on <a href="https://www.basicmicro.com/motor-controller">RoboClaw controllers by Basic Micro.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://sawppy.com">Sawppy</a> is running on LewanSoul <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/07/05/wrangling-rc-servos-becoming-a-hassle-try-serial-bus-servos/">serial bus servos</a>.</li>
<li>Mr. Blue is running on Dave's own custom controller boards.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have quite a rover family going!</p>
