<p>I'm setting aside my old Dell Latitude E6230 laptop <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/30/dell-latitude-e6230-getting-benched/">due to its multiple hardware failures</a>. At the moment I am using it to play with virtualization server software. Virtualization hosts usually run on rack-mounted server hardware in a datacenter somewhere. But an old laptop works well for light-duty exploration at home by curious hobbyists: they sip power for small electric bill impact, they're compact so we can stash them in a corner somewhere, and they come with a battery for surviving power failures.</p>

<p>I bought my Dell Inspiron 7577 15" laptop five years ago, because at the time that was <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/03/in-a-distorted-computer-component-market-buying-is-better-than-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the only reasonable way to get my hands on a NVIDIA GPU</a>. The market situation have improved since then, so I now have a better GPU on my gaming desktop. I've also learned I haven't needed mobile gaming power enough to justify carrying a heavy laptop around, so I got a lighter laptop.</p>

<p>RAM turned out to be a big constraint on what I could explore on the E6230. Which had a meager 4GB RAM and I couldn't justify spending money to buy old outdated DDR2 memory. Now I look forward to having 16GB of elbow room on the 7577.</p>

<p>While none of my virtualization experiments demanded much processing power, more is always better. This move will upgrade from a 3rd-gen <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/64896/intel-core-i53320m-processor-3m-cache-up-to-3-30-ghz.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core i5 3320M</a> processor to a 7th-gen <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/97456/intel-core-i57300hq-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-50-ghz.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core i5 7300HQ</a>. Getting four hardware cores instead of two hyperthreaded cores should be a good boost, in addition to all the other improvements made over four generations of Intel engineering.</p>

<p>For data storage, I've upgraded the 7577 from its factory M.2 NVMe SSD from a 256GB unit to a 1TB unit, and the 7577 chassis has an open 2.5" SATA slot for even more storage if I need it. The E6230 had only a single 2.5" SATA slot. Neither of these machines had an optical drive, but if they did, that can be converted to another 2.5" SATA slot with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/09/sata-optical-to-2-5-drive-adapter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adapters made for the purpose</a>.</p>

<p>Both of these laptops have a wired gigabit Ethernet port, sadly a fast-disappearing luxury in laptops. It eliminates all the unreliable hassle of wireless networking, but an Ethernet jack is a huge and bulky component in an industry aiming for ever thinner and lighter designs. [UPDATE: The 7577's Ethernet port would prove to be a source of headaches.]</p>

<p>And finally, the Inspiron 7577 has a hardware-level feature to improve battery longevity: I could configure its BIOS to stop battery charging at 80% full. This should be less stressful on the battery than being kept at 100% full all the time, which is what the E6230 would do and I could not configure it otherwise. I believe this deviation from laptop usage pattern contributed to battery demise and E6230 retirement, so I hope the 80% state of charge limit will keep the 7577 battery alive for longer.</p>

<p>When I started playing with KVM hypervisor on the E6230, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/27/home-assistant-os-in-kvm-hypervisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I installed Ubuntu Desktop instead of server for two reasons</a>: I didn't know how to deal with the laptop screen, and I didn't know how to work with KVM via the command line. Now this <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/01/configuring-laptop-for-proxmox-ve/">7577 configuration will incorporate what I've learned since then</a>.</p>
