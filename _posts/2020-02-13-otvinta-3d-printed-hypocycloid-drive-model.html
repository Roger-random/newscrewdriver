<p>Before I dive headfirst into <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/12/hypocycloid-drive-calculator-by-otvinta/">designing a project around hypocycloid drives</a>, I thought I should first try the low-effort test of printing up an existing design to see how it works. If it does, I get to see a printed hypocycloid drive in action. If it fails, I have data points on how to (and maybe not to) 3D print a hypocycloid drive.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, the very same site hosting a <a href="http://www.otvinta.com/cycloid.html">hypocycloid gear calculator</a> also has a <a href="http://www.otvinta.com/download05.html">ready-to-print set of STL files</a> for a 3D-printable hypocycloid speed reducer model. It looks like a nifty little hand-cranked demonstrator, so I fired up my 3D printer to print one of each STL. I noticed a lot of little artifacts on component mating surfaces. I was eager to see it in action, so I did only minimal cleanup with a blade before proceeding.</p>

<p>One instance of theory not meeting reality was in the crank handle. The geometry was designed such that the outer grip could rotate around a center shaft. They are printed in a single piece but there's a gap allowing the outer trip to break free and rotate about the center shaft. I've done this sort of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/12/16/parallel-link-pen-holder-only-a-minor-improvement/">designed breakaway</a> before, but this one didn't work well for me and it broke off at the wrong place, on the inner shaft instead of the outer handle. Oops.</p>

<p>Upon assembly I noticed a big gap, and some parts were falling out of place. It didn't take long before I realized there were two components (a cam and a disk) where I needed to print a second unit, rather than printing just one as I had done.</p>

<p>Once both disks were in place the overall system friction went up dramatically. Optimistically thinking they're just small bumps that can wear down with a few cycles, I tried to power past the friction points. But instead of breaking through sticky portions, I broke the input drive shaft.</p>
<p>I asked to print another drive shaft on a more precise 3D printer. While it was printing, the device was taken apart to better clean up surface artifacts. Round 2 was far more successful, making a fun toy and sufficiently prove the concept for future experimentation.</p>
