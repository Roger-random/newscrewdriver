<p>While <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/04/notes-on-vue-js-quick-start/">looking over Vue.js's Quick Start example</a>, I noticed its default set of tools included <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>. I understand it plays a role analogous but not identical to webpack in Angular's default tool set. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/04/02/webpack-first-look-did-not-go-well/">I found webpack's documentation quite opaque</a>, so I thought I would try to absorb what I can from Vite's documentation. I still don't understand all the history and issues involved in JavaScript build tools, but I was glad to find Vite documentation more comprehensible.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The introductory "<a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html">Why Vite?</a>" page explained Vite takes advantage of modern browser features for JavaScript code modules. As a result, the client's browser can handle some of the work that previously must be done on the developer machine via webpack &amp; friends. However, that still leaves a smaller set of things better done up front by the developer instead of later by the client, and Vite takes care of them.</p>

<p>In time I'll learn enough about JavaScript to understand what all that meant, but one section caught my attention. Given Vite's focus on leveraging modern browsers, I was surprised to see "browser compatibility" section included an official plug-in <code><a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy">@vitejs/plugin-legacy</a></code> to support legacy browsers. Given my interest in writing web apps that run on my pile of old Windows Phone 8, this could be very useful!</p>

<p>I opened up my NodeJS test apps repository and followed Vite's "Getting Started" guide to create a new project using the "vanilla TypeScript" template preset. To verify I've got it working as expected, I built and successfully displayed the results on a current build of Google Chrome browser.</p>

<p>Then I added the legacy plugin and rebuilt. It bloated the distribution directory up to 80 kilobytes, which is a huge increase but still almost a third of the size of a blank Angular app and quite manageable even in space-constrained situations. And most importantly: yes, it runs on my old Nokia Lumia 920 phone with Windows Phone 8 operating system. Nice! I'm <em><strong>definitely </strong></em>tucking this away in my toolbox for later use. But for right now, I should probably <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/06/notes-on-vue-js-tutorial/">get back to learning Vue</a>.</p>
