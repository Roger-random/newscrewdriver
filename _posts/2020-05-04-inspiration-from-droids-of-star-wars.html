<p>Today is the fourth day of the month of May, which has grown into "Star Wars day" due to "May the Fourth" sounding like that film's popular parting line "may the Force be with you." A quick search confirmed I've never explicitly said anything about Star Wars on this blog and that should be corrected.</p>
<p>By the time I saw Star Wars, I had already been exposed to popular science fiction concepts like space travel, interstellar commerce, and gigantic super-weapons. And the idea of a cult that promises to make their followers more special than regular people... we certainly didn't need science fiction for that. So none of those aspects of Star Wars were especially notable. What left a lasting impression was R2-D2.</p>
<p>R2-D2 had its own expression of duty and loyalty. Companion to humans, and a Swiss Army knife on wheels. A character that managed to convey personality without words or a face. R2-D2 was the most novel and compelling character for me in the film. I wouldn't go far as to say R2-D2 changed the path of my life, but there has definitely been an influence. More than once I've thought of "does this help me get closer to building my own R2" when deciding what to study or where to focus.</p>
<p>I was happy when I discovered there's an entire community of people who also loved the astromech droid and banded together to <a href="https://astromech.net/">build their own</a>. But that turned to disappointment when I realized the dominant approach in that community was focused on the physical form. Almost all of these were remote-controlled robots under strict control of a nearby human puppeteer, and little effort was put into actually building a capable and autonomous loyal teammate.</p>
<p>I can't criticize overly much, as my own robots have yet to gain any sort of autonomy, but that is still the ultimate long-term goal. I love the characters of R2-D2 and the follow-on BB-8 introduced in the newest trilogy. Not in their literal shape, but in the positive role they imagined for our lives. This distinction is sometimes confusing to others... but it's crystal clear to me.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>Oh, I thought you loved Star Wars.</em></p>
<p><em>Star Wars is fine, but what I actually love are the droids.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I still hope the idea becomes reality in my lifetime.</body></html></p>
