<p>Node-RED is built on sending messages from one node to the next. While there are some <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/14/node-red-recommended-best-practices/">recommended best practices</a>, it is really a wide-open system giving users freedom on how to structure the relationship between their nodes. As for the messages, they are JavaScript objects and there's <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/messages" target="_blank">a convention to structuring them</a> within a Node-RED project. While I can always fall back to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/12/node-red-function-nodes-are-a-comforting-fallback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing JavaScript</a> to work with messages, for the most part I don't have to. Between the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/13/node-red-cookbook-was-more-useful-after-some-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cookbook</a> and the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/14/node-red-recommended-best-practices/">Best Practices</a> document, there are many methods to accomplish some commodity programming flow control tasks without dropping to a JavaScript function node.</p>

<p>But the built-in nodes have limited data manipulation capabilities. So I thought anything that requires actual data manipulation requires dropping to code. I was pleasantly surprised to find I was wrong: simple text changes and similar manipulation can be done without dropping to a JavaScript function node, they can be done with a JavaScript-based query and transformation language <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jsonata.org/" target="_blank">called JSONata</a>.</p>

<p>JSONata appears to be an independent project not directly related to Node-RED, but it fits in very well with how Node-RED works and thus widely supported by many property fields of nodes. Any JavaScript string or data manipulation that could fit within a line or two of code can probably be expressed in JSOSNata, and thus accomplished directly in a standard Node-RED field without requiring dragging in a fully fledged JavaScript function node.</p>

<p>JSONata is yet another novelty in my exploration of Node-RED. I can vaguely sense this can be tremendously powerful, and I look forward to experimenting with this capability for future projects. But there's another technically-not-core Node-RED feature that I will <em>definitely</em> be using, and that is <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/16/fast-and-easy-ui-via-node-red-dashboard/">the Node-RED Dashboard</a>.</p>
