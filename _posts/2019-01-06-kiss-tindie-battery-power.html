<p>When I started the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/31/kiss-tindies-a-wire-form-practice-project/">KISS Tindie heads</a> project, the primary goal was and remains an exercise in forming shapes with copper wire. Making these copper wire bodies purely for cosmetic decoration with no functional circuit. With that goal met, I've changed my mind about nonfunctioning circuitry. I should at least give it a shot.</p>
<p>It was trivial to solder self-blinking LEDs into their designated slots on each PCB. The next challenge was to provide power to those LEDs. The original battery holder slot is no longer available - I've already used those contact pads to connect my copper wire bodies to these PCB heads. On the upside, it meant the wire bodies were ready to serve as ground plane.</p>
<p>The other major solder point was intended for a pin that lets us pin the Tindie Blinky on our clothing. I had soldered the positive leg of a LED to that pad and a long straight wire as a tripod to help the KISS Tindie stand up. I thought perhaps I could lay down some copper foil tape and my figures can draw power from that tape.</p>
<p>Once I had the wire soldered, though, I didn't like how it made my KISS Tindies look like they have a mind control cable sticking out the back of their heads. (See left side of picture at the bottom of this post.) Which meant another change of plans: give them each a coin cell battery holder made out of bent copper wire.</p>

<p>That loop of wire hugs the positive side of a coin cell battery, pushing the negative side against a KISS Tindie's copper wireframe body. This completes the circuit and the coin cell battery is the visible heart of each KISS Tindie.</p>

<p>And now, in order to stand, a short loop is soldered to the feet. This completes a self-sufficient KISS Tindie figure that stands on its own, as seen in the right side of the picture below. I find this much better than a wire sticking out the back of Tindie's head, seen on the left.</p>
