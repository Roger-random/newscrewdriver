<p>After <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/10/12/monoprice-creator-22-graphic-pen-display-item-39945/">unpacking a Monoprice Creator 22 graphical pen display</a> and installing its driver software, Windows 10 detected a pen input device and activated a few inking tools. One example was a digital sticky note I could use to jot things down. These tools were enough for me to verify that position and pressure information is getting into the system. I also noticed that whenever there is pen activity, one CPU core is completely consumed with kernel-level tasks. This is a hint the Bosto driver is spinning a CPU polling for input data whenever the pen is active. It is certainly a valid way to maximize pen input responsiveness, but not the most efficient. On the upside, we're now living in era of multicore processors. So I guess it doesn't matter too much if a CPU core is entirely occupied with pen input.</p>

<p>Sticky notes are fun, but I wanted to use a more powerful tool. Since I'm unwilling to spend significant money until I have more experience, I will start with the free option: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</a>. Loading up the current public stable release (2.10.32 as of this writing) I found it did not respond to my pen. Rummaging around the internet eventually found that GIMP only added support for Windows Ink compatible pen input devices about a year ago, in <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2021/10/20/gimp-2-99-8-released/#wider-coverage-of-input-devices-thanks-to-windows-ink-support">development version 2.99.8</a>. Uninstalling the stable release and installing the development release (2.99.12 of this writing) allowed me to select Windows Ink as GIMP's input API and draw using my new graphic display.</p>

<p>GIMP is a lot more powerful than a digital sticky note, and its user interface is infamously hostile to beginners. There are official documentation and online forums, of course, but I think a guided tour might be a good idea as well. I considered <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3emVAnc" target="_blank">The Book of GIMP</a></em> (*) by Lecarme and Delvare, but it was written almost ten years ago in 2013 for GIMP 2.8 so many details will be outdated. I might still skim through this book for the major strokes, or I might find a different book.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I need to put some effort into learning to draw. I've been doodling random things since I was old enough to hold a crayon, but I've never put any rigorous effort into developing the skill. I'm starting with <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3TbzGlz" target="_blank">The Fundamentals of Drawing</a></em> (*) by Barber. Not because the book is great (I don't know enough to judge yet) but because Amazon's "Look Inside" feature got far enough for the first exercise: practice hand control by drawing basic shapes. Can I stay focused enough to practice these drills and get good at them, so I could contemplate actually buying the book for the rest of it? Time will tell.</p>
