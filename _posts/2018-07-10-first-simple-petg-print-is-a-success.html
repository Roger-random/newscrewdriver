<p>Once the Maker Select reached "good enough" status it was back to work printing PLA parts for <a href="http://sawppy.com">Sawppy</a> in parallel with my Maker Ultimate. This allowed me to iterate through designs much more quickly and was instrumental in getting Sawppy built in time for its <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/05/08/rover-romping-at-jpl-first-public-appearance-of-sawppy-the-rover/">first public appearance at JPL's IT Expo</a>.</p>
<p>A few problems surfaced at this event, but the one that prompted a complete reprint of Sawppy was <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/23/sawppy-the-rovers-pla-wheels-deformed-under-heat/">PLA deformation</a> under Southern California summer heat. This is where the current 3D printer story line rejoins the rover construction story line. With this experience of plastic deformation, I now have motivation to try using a different material. There are a few options, and PETG presented the best tradeoff between temperature tolerance, ease of printing, and cost.</p>
<p>The first object to be reprinted in PETG were the steering servo couplers. This proved to be a weak point that needed to be addressed. The design was printed at 0.1mm layer height so the sideways hole for the M3 thread heat-set insert would have clear definition. (This turned out to be unnecessary - later couplers were printed at 0.3mm layer height and functioned adequately.)</p>
<p>I knew PETG had different requirement for printing, starting with print nozzle temperature. I started with my PLA print profile and dialed up the heat. In order to test layer bond in the print, and also to get a feel of PETG failure mode,Â I put the result in a vise and cranked the handle. I was happy to see PETG deformed rather than shattered as PLA would. Examination of the deformed object showed layer bonding is good. This is a good start for printing PETG.</p>
