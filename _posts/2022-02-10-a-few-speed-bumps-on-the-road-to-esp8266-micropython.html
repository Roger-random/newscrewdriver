<p>I decided to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/09/next-practice-round-micropython-on-esp8266/">play with MicroPython on an ESP8266</a> and started with MicroPython documentation page appropriately titled <em><a href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/quickref.html">Quick reference for the ESP8266</a></em>. It was <em>almost</em> (but not entirely) smooth sailing with the inexpensive <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3qetPjU" target="_blank">Wemos D1 Mini clone</a>(*) I had on hand.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I had recently switched desktop computers, with a fresh installation of Windows, so everything had to be reinstalled. Starting with Python, since I need that to <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool">run esptool tool</a> to flash Espressif devices. It got its own virtual Python environment with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a> and I could start working with the ESP8266.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I verified that flash size matched 4MB as per Amazon product listing with <code>esptool.py --port COM4 flash_id</code></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Then the first step in MicroPython directions: erase whatever might be in flash: <code>esptool.py --port COM4 erase_flash</code></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Followed by flashing the board with MicroPython, version 1.17 was the latest as of this writing: <code>esptool.py --port COM4 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 esp8266-20210902-v1.17.bin</code></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>

<p>That looked good! But I thought I'd verify anyway: <code>esptool.py --port COM4 --baud 460800 verify_flash --flash_size=detect 0 esp8266-20210902-v1.17.bin</code></p>

<p>This all looked good, but during this process I found communication with my board was unreliable. Occasionally I would fail to connect:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>esptool.py v3.1

A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to Espressif device: Invalid head of packet (0x08)</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The frustrating part is that I don't know what causes this, all I could do is retry until it worked. I didn't notice anything I did differently between the times that worked and the times that failed. Is it the ESP8266? Is it the CH340 serial port bridge? Is it my USB cable? I can't tell. The good news with MicroPython is that, once it is flashed, I could work via serial port without further headaches with <code>esptool</code>.</p>

<p>I remembered that PlatformIO Visual Studio Code had a serial port monitor, and it was indeed able to connect. But as the name stated, it was only a monitor and while I could see a MicroPython prompt I couldn't type any commands back. Looking around Visual Studio extension marketplace I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nordic-semiconductor.nrf-terminal" target="_blank">a serial terminal extension</a> published by Nordic Semiconductor. This allowed me to type commands into the MicroPython prompt and verify it worked, but frustratingly I could not copy/paste in this terminal. So much for a modern integrated environment! I returned to <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">trusty old PuTTY</a> for my MicroPython serial terminal needs and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/11/esp8266-micropython-automatically-remembers-wifi/">got to work</a>.</p>
