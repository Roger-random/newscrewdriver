<img class=" size-medium wp-image-1942 alignright" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/onshape_logo_medium.png?w=300" alt="onshape_logo_medium" width="300" height="83">When I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2016/07/26/onshape-notes/">first discovered Onshape</a> over two years ago, it was a novelty to see a capable CAD system run completely within my web browser. The technologies that made Onshape possible were still evolving at the time: on the client-side, web browsers had immature WebGL implementation that sometimes didn't work, or worked unacceptably slowly. And on the server side, Onshape is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/all-in-technology-partners-on-aws/">active participant in evolving AWS</a> to work for them.</p>
<p>Now WebGL is a mature part of every popular web browser, including those at the heart of inexpensive Chromebooks. I'm old enough that the phrase "CAD Workstation" conjured up computer systems that cost as much as a car. With Onshape, a Chromebook can be a CAD workstation! Not a great one to be sure, but more than enough for curious learners to get started. (<a href="https://www.onshape.com/cad-blog/under-the-hood-how-onshapes-development-team-tackles-cad-performance">This page</a> has more details on Onshape performance.)</p>
<p>This is why, when I started <a href="http://sawppy.com">Sawppy the Rover</a>, I switched from Fusion 360 to Onshape. Because I wanted Sawppy to be accessible to everyone, not just those who have a computer capable of Fusion 360. And I have continued to do so, not realizing another aspect of Onshape evolution had occurred.</p>
<p>This came up on my radar because of my super simple <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/27/copper-wire-spool-holder-with-straightener/">wire straightener project</a>. I've shared simple tools before, but this one caught more attention than most thanks to a <a href="https://twitter.com/MLE_Online/status/1079082227563024385">referral from Twitter</a> (and <a href="https://twitter.com/hackadayio/status/1079169047541891072">another</a>). I was surprised to see feedback in the theme of "I don't have an Onshape account" and was surprised people felt it was a barrier.</p>
<p>When I first started using Onshape, their sign-on screen would direct people to a page where people could sign up for an account. On this screen, a free plan for makers and hobbyists was prominently displayed.</p>
<p>That has been removed, hence the confusion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.onshape.com/products/free">free plan still exists</a>, but it's no longer on their "<a href="https://www.onshape.com/cad-pricing">CAD Pricing</a>" table and not mentioned in their "<a href="https://www.onshape.com/cad-blog/how-to-compare-onshape-plans">How to Compare Onshape Plans</a>" guide. From the <a href="https://www.onshape.com/faqs">FAQ</a> I inferred that it's not even possible to sign up for a free plan directly, one would have to start a trial for the Professional plan, decline to pay, and be downgraded to the free plan. (I can't test this hypothesis myself since I already have an established account on the free plan.)</p>
<p>I personally find this disappointing, but I'm not surprised. Onshape is a business and businesses have to be profitable or they'll disappear. I'm a little afraid this might mean they're working to phase out the free plan, but even in that case I hope they offer a subscription tier that's priced reasonably for hobbyists on tight budgets.</body></html></p>
