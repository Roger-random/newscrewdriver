<p>While I think over <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/21/what-to-do-with-retired-sonicare/">what I might do</a> with parts salvaged from a retired and disassembled Sonicare electric toothbrush, I played with its corresponding charging base.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/philips-sonicare-charging-base-hx6100-intact.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39213"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since both the toothbrush and the charging base are designed to sit on our bathroom sinks, they are both waterproof and have no exposed electrical contacts: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging" target="_blank">charging is done inductively</a>.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It doesn't transmit very much power, based on the label claim that it only draws up to 1.4W.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After prying off that bottom panel with the information label, I see a solid mass of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potting_(electronics)" target="_blank">potting compound</a> putting a quick end to this particular teardown session. What else can I do with this thing?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":39207,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/microwave-turntable-motor-coil-on-sonicare-charging-base-with-oscilloscope-probe.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39207"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I hooked up my oscilloscope probes to a coil <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/06/microwave-turntable-motor-tyj50-8a19/" target="_blank">salvaged from a microwave turntable motor</a> and set it on the charging base.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":39208,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/philips-hx6100-sonicare-charging-base-and-microwave-turntable-motor-coil.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39208"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The oscilloscope reads a ~85kHz sine wave with an amplitude of ~40V peak-to-peak. I played with coil position and was surprised to learn being slightly off-center hardly affected transmitted power.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/philips-sonicare-charging-base-hx6100-alignment-post-removed.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39242"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Removing the alignment post allowed me to go beyond the narrow range of axis alignment, where I confirmed the expected behavior: going too far decreased voltage transmitted. Inside the snapped-off alignment post was filled with a mystery black material. It is a brittle material that does not appear to be electrically conductive. A magnet is attracted to the broken-off post but I can't tell if that's necessarily this black stuff or perhaps there's a piece of steel embedded further inside.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/microwave-turntable-motor-coil-broken-connector.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39205"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I found some electrical connectors and tested to verify they mate with the microwave motor coil terminals. Unfortunately, these terminals were dependent on the now-absent external enclosure for strength. When I pulled on my connector, the whole terminal came out breaking the wire.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":39204,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/microwave-turntable-motor-coil-broke-wrong-wire.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39204"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And unfortunately, out of two wires I could have broken, I broke the inside wire. If I had broken the outside wire, it would have been pretty trivial to unwind a single loop to get some extra wire and solder it back on the terminal. But I broke the wire that's buried underneath the entire coil, making this impractical to repair.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":39206,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/microwave-turntable-motor-coil-copper-hairball.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39206"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I started pulling on wire just for the sake of seeing what it's like. This is extremely thin copper wire and there's a lot of turns in this coil. I ended up with an impressively large hairball of fine copper wire.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":39214,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sonicare-coil-attached.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39214"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's unfortunate I destroyed a salvaged coil that might have been fun for exploration. As fallback (or maybe they should have been the first option) I also have the Sonicare charging coils that were designed to work with this charging base. I kept it along with the bottom of the Sonicare enclosure to maintain precise alignment, though thanks to this experiment session I now know such alignment may not be strictly necessary.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":39210,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/philips-hx6100-sonicare-charging-base-and-sonicare-coil-unloaded.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39210"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I thought the fact it was a much smaller coil with far less wire would have meant I have a different voltage transformer. When sitting on the charging base, the oscilloscope reads about 34V peak-to-peak. I had expected more difference in voltage between the two coils.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some knife work separated the coil assembly from the rest of the toothbrush chassis.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What's the first step when exploring any electronic concept? Make it light some LEDs! Since this is an AC waveform, I soldered two salvaged LEDs side by side with opposite terminals.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":39202,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dc-power-lights-just-one-led.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39202"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When given DC power from my bench power supply, only one of the two LEDs would illuminate. If I reverse the polarity, the other LED would light up.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I didn't bother with electrical connectors this time: the test LED assembly was soldered directly to coil terminals.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I put it on the charging base and both LEDs lit up, the expected response to AC power.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":39217,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sonicare-coil-with-led-illuminated-plus-oscilloscope-probe.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39217"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I connected my oscilloscope probes to see how the waveform changed with this load added to the system.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/philips-hx6100-sonicare-charging-base-and-sonicare-coil-driving-led.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-39209"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I can see a bump at roughly +/- 3.7V, the voltage drop point for these little blue LEDs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That wraps a successful first test of using inductive power. Where might things go from here? If I can find the rectifiers I bought for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/04/27/hard-drive-brushless-motor-as-generator/" target="_blank">brushless motor generator experiment</a>, I can get some amount of DC power flowing. It won't be much power, a good chunk less than the 1.4W this charging base drew from the wall socket due to inductive power transmission losses. For comparison, slow USB charging is 5V @ 500mA or 2.5W, and that doesn't even have to deal with inductive transmission losses. So any project idea would either have to be a modestly powered system or incorporate a battery like a Sonicare.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While I wait for a project idea to emerge, I'll set this inductive charging base aside and go back to thinking about <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/23/good-time-to-revisit-kicad/">the toothbrush actuator and its control electronics</a>.</p>
