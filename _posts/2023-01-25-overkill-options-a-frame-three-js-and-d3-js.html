<p>After <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/24/as7341-adc-fullscale-and-led-illumination-control/">getting input controls sorted out</a> on my AS7341 interface project, it's time for the fun part: visualizing the output! Over the past few years of reading about web technologies online, I've collected a list of things I wanted to play with. My AS7341 project is not the right fit for these tools, so this list awaits a project with the right fit.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At this point I've taken most of Codecademy's current roster of courses under their HTML/CSS umbrella. One of the exceptions is "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-a-frame" target="_blank">Learn A-Frame (VR)</a>". I'm intrigued by the possibilities of VR but putting that in a browser definitely feels like something ahead of its time. "VR in a browser" has been ahead of its time since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1997's VRML</a>, and people have kept working to make it happen ever since. A brief look at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank">A-Frame documentation</a> made my head spin: I need to get more proficient with web technologies and have a suitable project before I dive in.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If I have a project idea that doesn't involve full-blown VR immersion (AS7341 project does not) but could use 3D graphics capability (still does not) I can still access 3D graphics hardware from the browser via WebGL. Which by now is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://caniuse.com/?search=webgl" target="_blank">widely supported across browsers</a>. In the likely case working directly with WebGL API is too nuts-and-bolts for my taste, there are multiple frameworks that help take care of low-level details. One of them is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a>, which was the foundation for a lot of cool-looking work. In fact, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.4.0/introduction/developing-with-threejs.html" target="_blank">A-Frame is built on top of Three.js</a>. I've dipped my toes in Three.js when I used it to build my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/13/hsv-color-wheel-of-256-rgb332-colors/">RGB332 color picker</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dropping a dimension to land of 2D, several projects I've admired were built using D3.js. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">This framework for building "Data-Driven Documents"</a> seems like a great way to interactively explore and drill into sets of data. On a similar front, I've also learned of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tableau.com/" target="_blank">Tableau</a> which is commercial software covering many scenarios for data visualization and exploration. I find D3.js more interesting for two reasons. First, I like the idea of building a custom-tailored solution. And second, Tableau was acquired by Salesforce in 2019. Historically speaking, acquisitions <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/11/19/heroku-free-rides-are-over/" target="_blank">don't end well for hobbyists on a limited budget</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All of the above frameworks are overkill for what I need right now for an AS7341 project: there are only a maximum of 11 different sensor channels. (Spectral F1-F8 + Clear + Near IR + Flicker.) And I'm focusing on just the color spectra F1-F8. A simple bar chart of eight bars would suffice here, so I went looking for something simpler and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/26/chart-js-for-visualizing-as7341-data/">found Chart.js</a>.</p>
