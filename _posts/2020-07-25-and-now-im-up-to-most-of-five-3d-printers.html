<p>When I first got started in 3D printing, I was well aware of the trend for enthusiasts in the field to quickly find themselves with an entire flock of them. I can confirm that stereotype, as now I am in the possession of (most of) five printers.</p>
<p>My first printer, a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2016/07/04/entering-the-world-of-3d-printing/">Monoprice Select Mini</a>, was still functional but due to its limitations I had not used it for many months. I had been contemplating taking it apart to reuse its parts. When I talked about that idea with some local people, I found a mutually beneficial trade: in exchange for my functioning printer, I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/09/27/repurposing-broken-3d-printer-x-axis-to-use-as-z-axis/">traded it for a nearly identical but non-functioning unit to take apart</a>.</p>
<p>My second, a Monoprice Maker Ultimate, has experienced multiple electrical failures with an infamous relay, and I suspect those failures had secondary repercussions that <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/12/20/monoprice-maker-ultimate-wanhao-duplicator-6-dead-again-but-this-time-it-was-not-the-relay/">triggered other failures in the system</a>. It is currently not working and awaiting a control board upgrade.</p>
<p>My third printer, a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/24/monoprice-maker-select-wanhao-duplicator-i3-as-rover-workhorse/">Monoprice Maker Select</a>, was very affordable but there were trade-offs made to reach that price point. I've since had to make several upgrades to make it moderately usable, but it was never a joyous ownership experience.</p>
<p>Those three printers were the topic of the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/02/09/my-monoprice-3d-printers-at-february-2019-rssc-meeting/">tale of 3D printing adventures</a> I told to Robotics Society of Southern California. One of my parting advise was that, once we get to the ~$700 range of the Maker Ultimate, there were many other solid options. The canonical default choice is a <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/">Prusa i3</a> and I came very close to buying one of my own several times.</p>
<p>What I ended up buying is a <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/Pulse">MatterHackers Pulse</a>, a derivative of the Prusa i3. I bought it during 2019's "Black Friday" sale season, when MatterHackers advertised their Pulse XE variant at a hefty discount. Full of upgrades that I would have contemplated installing anyway, it has performed very well and I can happily recommend this printer.</p>
<p>Why would I buy a fifth printer when I had a perfectly functioning Pulse XE? Well, I wouldn't. I didn't get this printer because it was better, I picked it up because it was free. I have some motion control (not 3D printing) projects on the candidate list and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/07/26/retired-geeetech-a10-3d-printer/">a retired partial Geeetech A10 printer</a> may prove useful.</p>
