<p>I bought some <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/22/fpc-and-breakout-boards-for-mx340-control-panel/">FPC (flexible printed circuit) cables and connector breakout boards</a> from Amazon vendors so I no longer have to solder wires directly to my salvaged Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet control panel. The first FPC breakout board went on a perforated prototype board to host a Raspberry Pi Pico. Up until this point I had been using Adafruit's KB2040 board. But since they're both based on RP2040 chip and have CircuitPython support, switching my code to run on a Pi Pico is a minor task of changing over a few pin names.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Soldering to the FPC breakout board with its 0.1" (~2.54mm) pitch was far easier than the 1.0mm pitch of soldering directly to the control panel. Which meant I finally got around to connecting five wires that were previously not connected:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>5 volt DC wire to supply WiFi LED</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>LED+ for Power LED, in series with an 100 ohm current-limiting resistor already on board.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>LED+ for Alarm LED, also with resistor.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Power button that is pulled to ground when pressed.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Stop button that is pulled to ground when pressed.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My CircuitPython code had provision to set the appropriate bit flags to manipulate the WiFi LED, but I hadn't tested it until this point due to lack of +5V power. I was happy to see it worked, but I doubt I would find a use for it. As it originally shined into a clear plastic light guide and thus pointed in an opposite direction from the rest of the control panel.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And I hadn't dealt with the remaining four wires at all, as I considered the two direct-wired buttons and two direct-wired LEDs fairly standard microcontroller fare. And indeed, there were no surprises after I declared two <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-digital-in-out">CircuitPython <code>digitalio</code> pins</a> for those LEDs and <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/key-pad-matrix-scanning-in-circuitpython">a <code>keypad</code> instance</a> to read (and debounce) those two buttons. All worked as expected on the first try.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I updated my test app to toggle power LED upon presses to the power button, and the same for alarm LED and the stop button. The "In Use/Memory" and WiFi LEDs blink their own separate heartbeat patterns. And the LCD displays status of key matrix scan code activity: every time one of the K13988-scanned button is pressed, its name is displayed on the LCD. It makes for a simple demo to prove I have complete control over all electronic functionality of this salvaged control panel. Now this control panel waits for a project that could put it to good use but while it's waiting, I went ahead with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/24/tiny-cat-galactic-squid-on-mx340-lcd/">a project that puts it to silly fun use</a>.</p>
