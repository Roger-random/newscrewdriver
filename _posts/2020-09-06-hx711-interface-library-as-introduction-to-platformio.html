<p>Whenever the goal is to find something quick and easy to talk with a piece of hardware, the standard operating procedure is to search for an Arduino library for that hardware. Hence after I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/05/connecting-hx711-amplifier-adc-board/">soldered connectors for a HX711 board</a> my search landed at the page for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/bogde/HX711" target="_blank">an Arduino HX711 library</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There was, however, a minor twist: this Arduino library is not in the form of an INO sketch or a downloadable ZIP file for the "Libraries" folder of the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standard Arduino IDE</a>. It uses an alternative in the form of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platformio.org/" target="_blank">PlatformIO</a> project. Normally requiring a new piece of software would make me hesitate and maybe continue searching for an alternative, but PlatformIO had been on my to-do list for some time and I thought this is a good place to dip my toes in.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>PlatformIO is available in several different forms, the most appealing for me is as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide" target="_blank">an extension to Visual Studio Code</a>. I've already been using VSCode for a few projects, even a few Arduino projects! In a strictly workaround sort of way, that is. There have been a few instances where an Arduino project got too annoying to use in the limited Arduino IDE so I copied the source file into VSCode, did my work, then copied it back into Arduino IDE for compilation and upload.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With PlatformIO installed as a VSCode extension, I shouldn't need to do that convoluted workaround. I can build and upload directly from within VSCode. That sounded really promising earlier, but not quite enough for me to pause my project the first time. Now that PlatformIO and I have crossed paths again, I'll <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/07/hx711-library-on-arduino-nano-via-platformio/">take a pause for a closer look</a>.</p>
