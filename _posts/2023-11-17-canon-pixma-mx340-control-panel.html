<p>This inkjet teardown is off to a great start, with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/16/canon-pixma-mx340-adf-lid/">an interesting mechanism</a> to feed the top sheet of document into the automatic document feeder (ADF) without requiring its own motors or wiring.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The next assembly I managed to free was the control panel.</p>

<p>I failed to find visible fasteners, but there were a few of these rectangular slots with arrows that <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/15/canon-pixma-mx340-base-panels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I have learned</a> was Canon engineer's way of indicating "Here's a plastic clip you can unlatch."</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unlatching a trio of them allowed me to slide out the white plastic trim underneath the control panel, exposing many other plastic clips and fasteners.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Which allowed removal of the control panel facade, exposing... another layer of plastic! The top layer is focused on appearance, this next layer handles mechanical functionality for all the buttons.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I had hoped the LCD module is in its own little standalone sub-assembly, because that would be the easiest for me to repurpose elsewhere. Sadly that doesn't look to be very likely here, as the screen is bonded to a segment of flex PCB with very fine pitched wires.</p>

<p>Flipping the control panel module over, I confirmed LCD connector is a tiny thing. The only other connector is for a white ribbon cable leading to the main board at the back of the printer. I see a single large IC on this board. The combination of LCD + buttons + single chip remind me of the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/23/pinout-of-tape-deck-faceplate-toyota-86120-08010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">control panel from a Toyota factory tape deck</a>. There's a chance this printer control panel is designed along a similar architecture. Maybe that single IC is in charge of scanning through and refreshing LCD segments as well as scanning the array of buttons?</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Removing all the visible fasteners allowed the plastic button mechanical layer to be separated from the electronic circuit board, where I could confirm this is a single-layer board. Right now I want to stay focused on mechanical disassembly, proceeding to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/18/canon-pixma-mx340-adf-motor-and-sensors/">disassemble the automatic document feeder</a>. I will return to this circuit board board later to investigate its electrical properties.</p>
