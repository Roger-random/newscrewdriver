<p>The previous few blog posts about my refurbished Dell Latitude E6230 was written several months ago and had sat waiting for a long-term verdict. After several months of use I'm now comfortable proclaiming it to be a very nice little laptop. Small, lightweight, good battery life, and decently high performance when I need it. (At the cost of battery life when doing so, naturally.)</p>
<p>The heart of this machine is a third generation Intel Core i5, which covers the majority of computing needs I've had while away from my desk. From the basics like 64-bit software capability to its ability to speed itself up to tackle bigger workloads. When working away from a wall plug and running on battery, the E6230 slows only minimally. Unlike my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/03/in-a-distorted-computer-component-market-buying-is-better-than-building/">much newer Inspiron 7577</a> which slows drastically while on battery to the extent that it occasionally felt slower than the E6230. I can run my 7577 for perhaps two to four hours on battery, never far from a reminder of its limited on-battery performance. Whereas I can run the E6230 for around four to six hours on battery, without feeling constrained by reduced performance.</p>
<p>The E6230 has several other features I felt would be <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/08/30/the-spectrum-of-ros-robot-brain-candidates/">good for a robot brain</a>. Top of the list is an Ethernet port for reliable communication in crowded RF environments. Several "SuperSpeed" USB 3 ports are useful for interfacing with hardware. And when I want more screen real estate than the built-in screen can offer, I have my choice of VGA or HDMI video output.</p>
<p>That built-in screen, with its minimal 1366x768 resolution, is about the only thing standing between this machine and greatness. Originally I did not care, because I had planned to tear the case apart and embed just the motherboard in a robot. But this laptop is working too darned well to be subjected to that fate! For the near future I plan to continue using the E6230 as a small laptop for computing on-the-go, and kept my eyes open for other old laptops as robot brain candidates.</p>
<p>An opportunity arose at Sparklecon 2020, when I mentioned this project idea to <a href="http://nuccinc.org/">NUCC</a>. They had a cabinet of laptops retired for one reason or another. I was asked: "What do you need?" and I said the ideal candidate would be a laptop with a broken screen and/or damaged keyboard, and have at least a Core i3 processor.</p>
<p>We didn't find my ideal candidate, but I <strong><em>did</em> </strong>get to bring home three machines for investigation. Each representing a single criteria: one with a busted screen, one with a busted keyboard, and one with a Core i3 processor.</p>
<p>Close enough! And now it's time for me to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/20/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-charge-and-split/">get to work on a research project</a>: determine what condition these machines are in, and how they can be best put to use.</p>
