<p>After the assembly session at April 2018 Third Thursday <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/">SGVHAK meet-up</a>, we could see the major outline of a rover but some parts were held only by friction and not yet properly fastened. Once everything was buttoned up, it uncovered a mechanical issue: there was a surprising amount of stress on the differential. Enough to bend its 8mm steel bar.</p>
<p>We need a brace to reinforce that bar.</p>
<p>The first version of the differential brace was made of four pieces - two pieces above the shaft, left-right and two pieces below. This was a beginner's mistake that didn't help <strong><em>at all</em></strong> against flexing because the stress went into narrowing/widening the gap between left/right pieces. Second version of the brace eliminated the left-right split and consisted only of two pieces - one above and one below the bar. Again, there's some looseness in the gap between these two pieces, but a few M3 fasteners kept its flex in check so overall bending of differential bar was dramatically reduced.</p>

<p>With the differential bar enforced, mechanical assembly for initial build is complete. The rocker-bogie suspension geometry is fully active and now we can proceed to build the electric wiring harnesses we'll need to bring <a href="http://sawppy.com">Sawppy the Rover</a> to life.</p>
