<p>With all the fun and excitement around 3D printing, I've let my Ruby on Rails education lapse. I want to dive back in, but it's been long enough that I felt I needed a review. Also, during my time away, the Ruby on Rails team released version 5, and Michael Hartl's <em><a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a></em> was updated accordingly.</p>
<p>Independent of the Rails 5 updates, it was well worth my time to go through the book again. On second run, I understood some things that didn't make sense before. It was also good to look at the first do-nothing "hello app" and the second automated-scaffold "toy app" with a little more Rails knowledge under my belt. The book is structured so the beginner reader didn't have to understand the mechanics of the hello or toy apps, but readers with a bit of understanding will get something out of it.</p>
<p>The release notes for the update mentioned that a few sections were rearranged for better pacing and structure, and added more exercises for readers to check their progress. Both are incremental improvements that I appreciated but neither were especially earth-shattering.</p>
<p>Action Cable, one of the big signature feature of Rails 5, was not rolled into the book. Hartl is handling that in a separate tutorial <em><a href="https://www.learnenough.com/action-cable-tutorial">Learn Enough Action Cable to be Dangerous</a></em> which I will go through at some point in the near future.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the book, Hartl introduced an optional advanced concept: using Amazon Web Services to store user image uploads. I skipped that section the first time through, and decided to dive into it this time.</p>
<p>I quickly found myself in aÂ deep rabbit hole. Amazon Web Services has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products">many moving parts</a> designed for a wide range of audiences and it's a challenge to get started without being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Which is where I am now. Lots more exploration ahead!</p>
