<p>By the time I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/26/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-first-pass-evaluation/">wrapped up investigation of the HP Split tablet/laptop convertible</a>, the Targus <a href="https://us.targus.com/products/device-power-tip-pt-i">type I adapter</a> arrived. I needed it to charge the battery in the remaining two machines of my research assignment from <a href="https://www.nuccinc.org">NUCC</a>. I set aside the HP Split and started charging the Toshiba Chromebook. Once the charge LED turned from orange to white, I turned it on and the answer to "why was this machine retired?" was immediately apparent.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20562" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-screen-detail.jpg" alt="Toshiba Chromebook 2 CB35-B3340 screen detail" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>There is a large diagonal crack across the middle of the screen. Sometimes when a screen is damaged we could still read the content around the crack, but not here. The entire screen is illegible. Turning the machine on and off a few times, I saw the content is not consistent between runs. Either Chrome OS is booting to a dynamic splash screen every time, or what's visible just have no correlation with the intended content.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this Chromebook has a HDMI video output port. Plugging it into a monitor, I see a very pretty picture of a night time landscape. This is probably a background picture, but without any controls, it is merely the secondary screen. The login prompt is still on the primary display I can't read.</p>
<p>Since this was my first Chromebook, I didn't know if there was a key combination I could press to toggle from this "extended" mode to "mirrored" mode where the login screen is sent to both displays. A little bit of research implied that there was, and a few minutes of fumbling found the magic keystroke: control plus an icon that might be maximizing a window or possibly going full screen.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's common to all Chromebooks or specific to this model, but at the moment it doesn't matter. I can see the ChromeOS login screen on my external monitor, time to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/28/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-reset-and-restart/">get down to business</a>.</p>
