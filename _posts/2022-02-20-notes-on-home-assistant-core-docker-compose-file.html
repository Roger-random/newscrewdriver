<p>I'm playing with Home Assistant and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/19/notes-on-home-assistant-core-vs-home-assistant-operating-system/">I started with</a> their <em>Home Assistant Core</em> Docker container image. After a week of use, I understood some of the benefits of going with their full <em>Home Assistant Operating System</em>. If I like Home Assistant enough to keep it around I will likely dig up one of my old computers and make it a dedicated machine. In the meantime, I will continue evaluating Home Assistant by running <em>Home Assistant Core</em> in a container. The documentation even gave us a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file all ready to go:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>version: '3'
services:
  homeassistant:
    container_name: homeassistant
    image: "ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable"
    volumes:
      - /PATH_TO_YOUR_CONFIG:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is fairly straightforward, but I had wondered about the last two lines.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>    privileged: true</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First question: why does it need to run in privileged mode? I couldn't find an answer in Home Assistant documentation. And on the other end, official <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#privileged" target="_blank">Docker compose specification</a> just says:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><code>privileged</code>Â configures the service container to run with elevated privileges. Support and actual impacts are platform-specific.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So the behavior of this flag isn't even explicitly defined! For the sake of following directions, my first launch of Home Assistant Core image specified true. Once I verified it was up and running, I took down the container and brought it back up without the flag. It seemed to work just fine.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One potential explanation: upon initial startup, Home Assistant needed to create a few directories and files in the mapped volume <code>/config</code>. Perhaps it needed the privileged flag to make sure it had permissions to create those files and set their ownership properly? If so, then I only needed to run with the flag for first execution. If not, then that flag may be completely unnecessary.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>    network_mode: host</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Second question: why does it need to run in host network mode? Unlike privileged, network mode is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#network_mode" target="_blank">much better defined</a> and host means "gives the container raw access to host's network interface". I tried running Home Assistant Core with and without this flag. When running without, Home Assistant could no longer automatically detect ESPHome nodes on the network. Apparently auto-discovery requires running in host network mode, and it's a big part of the convenience of ESPHome. In order to avoid the tedium of getting, tracking, and typing in network addresses, I shall keep this line in my Docker compose file while <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/21/hello-home-assistant/">I play with Home Assistant Core</a>.</p>
