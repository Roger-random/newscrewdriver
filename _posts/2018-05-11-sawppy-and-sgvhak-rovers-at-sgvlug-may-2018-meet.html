<p>Yesterday was the monthly meeting of San Gabriel Valley Linux Users Group (<a href="http://www.sgvlug.org/">SGVLUG</a>) for May 2018. <a href="http://www.sgvhak.org/">SGVHAK</a>, the maker hacker group who built a rover, is a subset of SGVLUG and we got to present our project to the wider community.</p>
<p>The night's presentation started with Eric Junkins of JPL talking about how <a href="https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov">JPL's Open Source Rover</a> came about. Several groups were invited to beta test the build instructions before public release and that was the stage where SGVHAK got involved. SGVHAK made a few changes to the baseline design for our own take on the project, exactly as the nature of open source release intended.</p>
<p>Towards the end Sawppy the Rover got a few minutes in the spotlight as a spin-off rover that was inspired by JPL's Open Source Rover project. I got to talk about how it came out of an offhand comment by Eric and eventually I delivered a basic chassis that met his challenge of a $500 price point. It is not as fast, nor as powerful, nor as flexible as the JPL open source rover design. These were all trade-offs made in the name of hitting that price point.</p>
<p>After the presentation both rovers ventured out to the parking lot behind our meeting location (<a href="http://www.dupars.net/Store/locations/">Du-Par's Pasadena</a>) and ran around for a while, attracting attention from passers-by along the way. The rovers may have managed to recruit a few new members to SGVLUG. We'll see!</body></html></p>
