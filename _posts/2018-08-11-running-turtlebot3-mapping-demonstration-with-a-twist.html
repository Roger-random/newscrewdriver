<p>We've found our way to the source code for the simple <code>turtlebot3_drive</code> node. It's a simple starting point to explore writing code in ROS that'll be worth returning to in the future. In the meantime I keep looking at the other fun stuff available in ROS... like making the robot a little bit smarter. Enter the TurtleBot SLAM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping">simultaneous location and mapping</a>) demonstration <a href="http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#virtual-slam-with-turtlebot3">outlined in the manual</a>.</p>
<p>Like all of the TurtleBot3 demo code from the e-Manual, we start by launching the Gazebo simulation environment.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Then we can launch the node to run one of several different algorithms. Each have strengths and weaknesses, this one has the strength of "it's what's in the manual" for a starting point.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Note: If this node failed to launch with the error <code>ERROR: cannot launch node of type [gmapping/slam_gmapping]: gmapping</code> it means the required module has not been installed. Install (on Ubuntu) with <code>sudo apt install ros-kinetic-slam-gmapping</code>.</p>
<p>If successful, this will launch RViz and we can see the robot's map drawn using what it can detect from its initial position.</p>

<p>To fill out the rest of the map, our virtual TurtleBot needs to explore its space. <a href="http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#virtual-slam-with-turtlebot3">The manual</a> suggests running the '<code>turtlebot3_teleop</code>' module so we can use our keyboard to drive TurtleBot around turtle world. But I think it's more fun to watch the robot map its own world, so let's launch <code>turtlebot3_drive</code> instead.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Using this simple self-exploration mode the turtle world will be mapped out eventually. How long this will take depends on luck. One interesting observation is that there's no explicit randomness in the <code>turtlebot3_drive</code> source code, but because the Gazebo simulation environment inserts randomness in the data to simulate unpredictability of real sensors, <code>turtlebot3_drive</code> ends up being a random walk.</p>
<p>Once our robot has completed mapping its world, we can save it for the navigation demo.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map</code></p></blockquote>

<p>More details on how to tune SLAM algorithm parameters are in the <a href="http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/slam/">SLAM chapter of the manual</a>, which is mainly focused on running the real robot rather than simulation but most of the points still apply.</body></html></p>
