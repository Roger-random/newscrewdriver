<p>I wanted to add CarPlay/Android Auto capability to my 2004 Mazda RX-8 by replacing the screen of the ancient Mazda factory navigation system. I picked out <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/02/carplay-and-android-auto-receiver-for-2004-mazda-rx-8/">a standalone wireless receiver</a> with features I liked and a physical size that I hoped would fit. When my <a href="https://amzn.to/44PY8Pw">TTXSCAM T86</a> (*) showed up, there was a satisfying quantity of stuff in the box.</p>

<p>I immediately went to the manual (which called the device a T86MP5) and found it to be nearly useless. A thin booklet of 22 meager pages that didn't cover basic information like installation or anything about the backup camera. I think I'm on my own to figure out most of this device.</p>

<p>It came with two sets of mounting hardware. One for the top of the dashboard, either by the included double-sided adhesive or four fastener holes. And the other is a suction cup mount either to the windshield or to the included a smooth plastic disc, also with double-sided adhesive. I will mount this device inside a piece of existing interior trim, so I won't be using either of these mounting arms.</p>

<p>It also came with a 3.5mm stereo audio cable, and a power cable that plugs into the de facto in-car power source form factor that traces its origin to a cigarette lighter. The device end of this power adapter is a USB type C plug, but this adapter is not a full USB PD (Power Delivery) source. It only claims to deliver 5 Volts at up to 3 Amps.</p>

<p>Majority of the parts count are associated with the backup camera. Electrically, there's a wiring harness long enough to run the length of the car, various zip ties and other cable management tools, even a roll of electrical tape. I didn't recognize the red plastic pieces and had to search online to learn they are T-tap connectors. Further reading taught me I am supposed to use them to tap into the reverse light power wire, so the system knows to turn on the backup camera.</p>

<p>Mechanically, this package included a license plate bracket and associated hardware to mount the camera top and center above the license plate. I can't use this directly as-is because the RX-8 has its license plate illumination light centered above the plate, and this mount would block that light with the camera. I will have to modify the bracket, or existing light, or get creative with something else.</p>

<p>I was charmed by the inclusion of a few tools. A tiny screwdriver to work with the small camera-mounting screws, and a large piece of orange pry bar for removing interior trim. Something I'll be doing a lot to run the camera wiring harness through the car. Looks like a proper backup camera installation will be a lot of work. Fortunately, I can put that off until later. The next order of business is to explore how this receiver works <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/04/first-impressions-of-carplay-and-android-auto-receiver-ttxscam-t86/">with a benchtop test</a>.</p>
