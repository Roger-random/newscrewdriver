<p>With the core components and the auxiliary accessories installed, I have a usable computer. It is time to find out how much this setup weighs.</p>
<p>Weighing this configuration establishes a lower bound for the final contraption. Whatever a complete luggable enclosure may weigh, it must have all the parts present on this first draft, so it'd be impossible to be any lighter.</p>
<p>Luggable PC Mark I weighs in at 17.5 pounds and while it is no lightweight, I've had no problems lifting it by the handle and carrying it around. Some of the credit goes to the <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110302360250/?HissuCode=HHDFL19&amp;PNSearch=HHDFL19">strong and smooth handle sold by Misumi</a> for the HFS-5 extrusion. (HHDFL19) The strength gives confidence for carrying and the smooth surface helps make it comfortable.</p>
<p>Tux Lab's "Luggable Frame" project with the Yamakasi Catleap 28" monitor and the HP Z220 small form factor case sets the upper bound for weight. While it can be carried short distances (say, across the room) at over 30 pounds it is not practical to carry much farther. I expect Mark II to be lighter than that combination, but would it be lighter by a useful amount?</p>
<p>I didn't need precise measurements - it's just for a rough baseline - so I used the most convenient weight measuring device: my bathroom scale. I mentally gave myself a drum roll as the bathroom scale took measure of the Luggable PC Mark II...</p>

<p>And the number that came up was... 16 pounds!</p>
<p>That's not a bad starting point. I expect the final enclosure to weigh more than 1.5 pounds, so the first usable luggable Mark II will weight more than Mark I. That's not a huge surprise since the larger screen is significantly heavier than a salvaged laptop panel. The challenge would be to keep the weight as low as it is feasible.</p>
<p>Given a bare-bones skeleton baseline of 16 pounds, I've set for myself a target weight for the final product at 20 pounds.</p>
<p>Onward to the next iteration.</p>
