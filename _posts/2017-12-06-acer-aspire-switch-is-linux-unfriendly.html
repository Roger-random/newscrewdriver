<p>Now that the hardware of an <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/CA/content/support-product/5547?pn=NT.L4TAA.018">Acer SW5-012</a> (Aspire Switch 10) is back up and running, the focus turns to software. Windows 8 is installed but locked with passwords I don't have. I didn't care much for Windows 8 anyway, and whatever data exists is not mine to recover. So - a clean wipe is in order.</p>
<p>As with the Latitude X1, my first thought was to turn this little old machine into an almost-Chromebook with <a href="https://www.neverware.com">Neverware CloudReady</a>. And just like with the Latitude X1, the attempt was foiled. The Latitude X1 was too old and did not support some processor features required by CloudReady. The Acer problem is just the opposite - the hardware is too <em>new</em> and deliberately blocks the installation.</p>
<p>The blocking mechanism isÂ <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot">Secure Boot</a>, which according to its own web site is a "<em>security standard developed by members of the PC industry to help make sure that a device boots using only software that is trusted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.</em>" I would describe it with different terms. Either way, trying to install CloudReady - or a Linux distribution - results in the error screen "Secure Boot Error".</p>
<p>Intentional or not, this puts the Acer in a bad state. It gets stuck neither fully on nor off, the screen dark but burning battery power and making itself warm. I had to disassemble the computer again to pull the battery from the main circuit board in order to reboot the machine.</p>
<p>In theory Secure Boot can be disabled, but <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/answers/id-2538379/acer-aspire-sw5-012-refuses-boot-windows-recovery.html">various efforts by other people</a> on the internet indicated this isn't straightforward. I certainly had no better luck when I tried it: I can see the menu option, and I could change it from black on white (disabled) to white on gray (enabled) by creating an admin password, but I couldn't figure out how to actually change the Secure Boot mode out of "Standard".</p>

<p>And it might not even be worth the effort, as forum traffic indicates there is very poor Linux driver support for this class of hardware. Probably related to the secure boot barrier but either way I'm giving up. I'll stay with Windows on this machine.</p>
