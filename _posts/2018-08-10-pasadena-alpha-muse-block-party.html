<p>I appreciate being near Pasadena, California. It is a large enough community to have an organization like <a href="https://www.innovatepasadena.org/">Innovate Pasadena</a>, focused on spreading the word about some pretty interesting things in the area. A recent announcement on the mailing list was for an event titled <em>Pasadena Alpha Muse Block Party</em>. The title didn't mean anything to me, and even after reading the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pasadena-alpha-muse-block-party-tickets-46387107086#">Eventbrite page</a> I only have a vague idea what to expect. But it is at a location I haven't visited, and the event promised local companies, artists, and musicians. That was interesting enough to investigate.</p>
<p>The venue, <a href="https://www.ctrlcollective.com/pasadena/">CTRL Collective</a>, appears to be a co-working facility along similar lines to WeWork or Cross Campus, except it seems to be more focused on creative companies versus technical. I'm sure there are other competitive differences that I failed to pick up, but it is generally along the lines of a facility that hosts multiple small companies who share a common infrastructure. There are offices upstairs, and downstairs is an open area for collaborative work or it can be opened up for events like today.</p>

<p>Trying to learn about the companies represented by each table was difficult, because the musicians were playing at far too loud of a volume for conversation. Nevertheless, some interesting companies stood out. Top of the list is <a href="https://www.stemworld.net">STEM World Pasadena</a>. Their main focus is after-school STEM education for school age children, but they also advertise a <a href="https://www.stemworld.net/makers-space.htm">maker space</a> with laser cutter and CNC engraver, which is good motivation for me to go check out their facility.</p>
<p>Happily, there were more than enough interesting artists present, offering different styles for the audience to find something that speaks to them. Sometimes the different styles come from a single artist. <a href="http://www.aliciagorecki.com/">Alicia Gorecki</a> had many pieces featuring different topics like architecture, people, and a few others. Each of which had a different style. I loved the series with little just-hatched baby birds in black-and-white line art. I didn't <em>quite</em> love them enough to buy an original (one of which Alicia is holding up here) but I did buy a greeting card of that series.</p>

<p>And no, I never did figure out what the event's title "Alpha Muse" meant.</p>
