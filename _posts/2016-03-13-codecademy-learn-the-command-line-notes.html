<p>This course would be more accurately titled "Learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a>" though the beginner audience wouldn't necessarily understand that title. Most of it is broadly applicable to the various command line shells used in Unix &amp; relatives, but some parts are specific to Bash. It's fine: most Linux distributions default to Bash, and it's close enough to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)">command line of the Mach+BSD</a> blend that underlies modern MacOS.</p>
<p>Neither Microsoft's legacy DOS command line nor the newer PowerShell are mentioned.</p>
<p>The course is a very brief overview of the basics.</p>
<ul>
<li>File system hierarchy traversal</li>
<li>File manipulation and management</li>
<li>Some of the common command line tools like "grep" and "cat"</li>
<li>Trivial Bash environment customization via .bash_profile</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em><strong>organization</strong> </em>of the class is a little different. Most of Codecademy are set up to first teach a concept then ask the student to try it themselves in the class environment. The command line class is the opposite: it asks the student to type in things before explaining what just happened.</p>
<p>I am comfortable learning by hands-on tinkering. After I followed the instructions and typed in stuff like a trained monkey, I stopped and tried to guess what I just did before reading the answer. I believe retain the information better if I successfully reason out the logic during this guessing period.</p>
<p>But it doesn't fit in the standard Codecademy template so it comes across as a little odd. I personally prefer it but I can understand if some people would not.</body></html></p>
