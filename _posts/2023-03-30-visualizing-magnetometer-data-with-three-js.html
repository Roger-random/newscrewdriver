<p>I'm happy that my simple exploratory web app was able to obtain data from my phone's integrated magnetometer. I recognize <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/29/magnetometer-api-privacy-concerns/">there are some downsides to how easy it was</a>, but right now I'm happy I can move forward. Ten times a second (10Hz is the maximum supported update rate) my callback receives x, y, and z values in addition to auxiliary data like a timestamp. That's great, but the underlying meaning is not very intuitive for me to grasp. What I want next is a visualization of that three-axis magnetometer data.</p>

<p>I turned to the JavaScript 3D graphics library <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>. The last time I used Three.js was to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/13/hsv-color-wheel-of-256-rgb332-colors/">visualize the RGB332 color space</a>, using a 2D projection to help me make sense of data along three dimensions of color: a cylinder representing HSV color space and a rectangular solid representing RGB. Now I want to visualize a single vector in three-dimensional space representing the local magnetic field as reported by my phone's magnetometer. I was a little intimidated by the math for calculation 3D transforms. I tried to make my RGB332 color app transition between HSV and RGB color space but it never looked right because <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/15/notes-of-a-three-js-beginner-euler-angles-vs-quaternions/">I didn't understand the 3D transform math</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this time I didn't have to do any of my own math at all. Three.js has a built-in function that accepts the x, y, and z components of a target coordinate and calculates the rotation required to have a 3D project <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D.lookAt">look at that point</a>. My responsibility is to create an object that will convey this information. I chose to follow the precedence of an analog compass which is built out of a small magnetic needle. Shaped like a narrow diamond with one half painted red and the other half painted white. For this 3D visualization I created a shape out of two cones, one red and one white. When this shape looks at the magnetometer vector, it functions very similarly to the sliver of magnet inside a compass.</p>

<p>As a precaution, I added <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/By_example/Detect_WebGL">a check for WebGL</a> before firing up Three.js code. I was pretty confident any Android Chrome that supported the magnetometer API would support WebGL as well, but it was good practice to confirm.</p>

<p>One thing I'm not doing (but should) is to account for screen orientation. Chrome developers have added <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/generic-sensor/#synchronization-with-screen-coordinates">a feature to automatically adjust for screen orientation</a> but right now I'm just going to deactivate auto-rotate on my phone (<a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/31/array-of-android-magnetometers/">or... phones</a>!)</p>
