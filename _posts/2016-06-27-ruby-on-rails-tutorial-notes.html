I had missed it the first time I went through the Getting Started guide, but when I reviewed the guide a second time (things made a lot more sense) I noticed and decided to check it out.</p>
<p>I'm very glad that I did!</p>
<p>For the most part, this book (available as paper edition, but the author had made it freely readable online on the web site) was exactly what I had hoped to find for Ruby on Rails. The book went through the process of making a Rails app three times, in exactly the progression I wanted:</p>
<p><em><strong>First pass:</strong> </em>A simple "hello world" that does nothing much but lets the student experience all the standard overhead around creating and deploying a Rails app. It's barely a Rails lesson at all: it's really a lesson for learning the surrounding infrastructure before digging into the meat of learning Rails.</p>
<p><strong><em>Second pass:</em> </strong>A simple "toy app" that does a lot... but the student is rushed through without understanding what's going on behind the scene. It's really a demonstration of what's possible via Rails helpers &amp; scaffolding and less about learning Rails. It reminds me of what the Codecademy Ruby on Rails "class" was like. A lot of incomprehensible fancy flash. However, unlike Codecademy which left me asking "now what?" Rails Tutorial follows up.</p>
<p><em><strong>Third pass</strong></em>: Over 80% of the book is spent building the "sample app." Starting from a site that can serve a few static pages and grows, bit by bit, into a mini clone of Twitter. It had creation and maintenance of user accounts, authentication, posting 140-character messages, following &amp; un-following users, all the core bits we associate with Twitter. (Which, the author asserted, was also originally built using Ruby on Rails.)</p>
<p>The Codecademy Rails class left me confused and feeling like I've wasted my time. (About a day.)</p>
<p>The Rails Guides left me with a basic level of comprehension of what goes on in a Rails app. My time (About half a week) is well spent, but I didn't feel like I could build anything on my own yet.</p>
<p>After the Ruby on Rails Tutorial (which took me over a week) I feel like I have all the basic tools I need to start playing in the Rails playground. I feel like I have an idea how to get started, how to experiment, understand what the experiment does behind the scenes, and debug whatever goes wrong while I experiment.</p>
<p>And with that, it's time to practice using my new tools: Let's build something!</body></html></p>
