<p>A nifty-looking 3D-printed computer case came across my attention recently: <a href="https://modcase.com.au/products/nas">Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) by MODCASE</a>. Just like the name says, it is a modular stackable system for building data storage servers, featuring a core module for the motherboard and PSU and however many hard drive modules you want. There is a paid version with additional features but I wanted to try the free version first as it should be sufficient for my immediate needs. I downloaded the <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/590711-nas-itx-pc-case-with-stackable-expansions">3D printer STL data files from Printables.com</a>, and dusted off my 3D printer for a go.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>My objective is to give the guts of my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/01/12/luggable-pc-mark-ii-decommissioned/">decommissioned Luggable PC Mark II</a> a decent home. The Mini-ITX motherboard and compact SFF power supply had been taking up a full-sized tower case and that is silly. Especially since it doesn't have any storage drives: at the moment it is a Proxmox server and all I need is the M.2 NVMe SSD on the motherboard. So why am I printing a storage server case? Because (1) I think this will become a storage server in the future and, (2) for today I can print just MASS core without the storage modules.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Printing MASS modules proved to be challenging due to many sharp right-angle corners that want to lift as PETG cooled. I know my print bed adhesion is not perfectly dialed in and MASS rubbed it in my face with multiple failed prints.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once printed and assembled, though, MASS core was impressively compact. Here is a size comparison against a Cooler Master Mini-ITX case. For my current purpose I did not need the externally accessible 5.25" drive capability or three internal 3.5" drive bays, nor do I need to accommodate a full-sized ATX power supply. Trading off those capabilities meant MASS has roughly 1/3 of the volume. And this is with a fairly thick and robust design, as it may potentially be asked to support the weight of multiple drive modules. I think 1/4 volume is achievable if the case doesn't need to be as robust.</p>

<p>Since MASS is a 3D-printed case, we are on our own to supply all components that typically come with a commercial computer case. Mounting screws and nuts, external USB ports, etc. A critical component is a normally-open momentary-close power switch. I enlarged the provisioned buttonhole to fit an illuminated button <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/09/29/formlabs-form-1-internals-on-workbench/">I salvaged from a dead Form Labs Form 1+</a>.</p>

<p>The power supply side of my build is pretty packed with power cables. There would be less crowding if a power supply with modular cable system is used instead.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The mainboard side, however, is unobstructed which is great for cooling. It would also ease routing SATA cables necessary to turn this into a storage server. This particular motherboard has six SATA ports, but Mini-ITX boards typically have fewer.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For more storage capability, there might be enough room for a low-profile HBA (Host-Based Adapter) card from a vendor like <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_ssn=theartofserver&amp;store_name=theartofserver">Art of Server</a>. But without a way to screw the metal back plate down, it would not be held securely. This is one reason to step up to the premium version of MASS as it has explicit provision for installing a low-profile PCIe card.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>MASS side panels are held in place with stumps that clip into the case. These stumps are liable to break off if layer adhesion is less than perfect. Apparently mine are not!</p>

<p>I have put my MASS core into service and it has worked well so far. If somebody has a 3D printer that can avoid my issues with corner lifting or layer adhesion, MASS is a great choice. If their printer isn't perfectly dialed in, I would warn to expect some level of print frustration. I probably won't print MASS again but that's no fault of the design. I'm just more likely to take a stab at designing my own case reflecting my own priorities.</p>
