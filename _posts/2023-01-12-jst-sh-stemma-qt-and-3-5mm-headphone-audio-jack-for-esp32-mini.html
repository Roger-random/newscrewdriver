<p>It was an interesting challenge to write code which <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/10/as7341-spectral-color-sensor-with-mozzi-on-avr-arduino/">talked to an AS7341 spectral color sensor using Mozzi's <code>twi_nonblock</code> API for I2C communication</a>. I referenced Adafruit's AS7341 library heavily, but I couldn't copy much (any?) code directly on account of the differences between Arduino Wire I2C and <code>twi_nonblock</code>. But <code>twi_nonblock</code> is only supported for AVR chips, and Mozzi runs on additional architectures <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/sensorium/Mozzi#esp32" target="_blank">such as ESP32</a>. Can I get AS7341 to play nice with Mozzi on those platforms?</p>

<p>For my earlier AVR adventures, I laid out my hardware components on a breadboard. This time, with a bit more confidence, I'm going to wire the components point-to-point without a breadboard. Which means I am free to use my breadboard unfriendly <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/09/03/wemos-d1-mini-esp32-derivative/">ESP32 Mini board</a> and equip it for integrating Mozzi with AS7341.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>For Mozzi audio output on AVR ATmega328 Arduino Nano, I wired an earbud headphone directly to pin D9. I was comfortable doing this as the ATmega328 is a fairly robust chip tolerant of simple direct designs like this. However, the ESP32 is not designed for similar scenarios, and I should take a bit of effort to make sure I don't kill my chip. Thankfully Mozzi <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/learn/output/" target="_blank">has a guide on how to connect audio</a> with an RC (resistor+capacitor) filter which should be better than nothing to protect the ESP32 pin used for audio output. According to Mozzi documentation, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/sensorium/Mozzi#esp32" target="_blank">both GPIO25 and GPIO26 are used</a>. I soldered my resistor to GPIO26.</p>

<p>For audio hardware interface, I used a 3.5mm jack salvaged from a cheap digital photo frame I tore down long ago. (Before I started documenting my teardowns on this blog.) This was technically the video output port with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)#TRRS_standards" target="_blank">four conductors inside the 3.5mm TRRS jack</a> for composite video, audio left, audio right, and ground. But I only need two of the wires: ground plus one audio signal. The other two wires were left unused here.</p>

<p>For AS7341 interface, I dug up my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3QcGq2l" target="_blank">pack of JST-SH connectors</a> (*) originally bought <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/08/15/my-beaglebone-boards-returning-to-their-box/" target="_blank">for a BeagleBone Blue</a> but went unused. This is mechanically compatible with Adafruit's STEMMA QT connectors on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4698" target="_blank">their AS7341 breakout board #4698</a>. However, the wire colors in my pack of pre-crimped connectors do not match convention for how they are used in a STEMMA QT. Testing for continuity, I found the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>White = Ground (GND) should be black</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Yellow = Power (VIN) should be red</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Black = Data (SDA)</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Red = Clock (SCL)</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I briefly contemplated popping individual pre-crimped wires out of the connector and rearranging them, then I decided this was a quick hack prototype and I didn't care enough to spend time fiddling with tiny fussy connectors. (This is why I bought them pre-crimped!) Hopefully this decision wouldn't come back to bite me later. I soldered I2C data wire (black) to GPIO21 and I2C clock wire (red) to GPIO22. Power and ground went to their respective pins on the ESP32 Mini.</p>

<p>This should be enough hardware for me to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/13/performing-as7341-sensor-integration-in-parallel-resolved-mozzi-glitches/">start investigating the software side</a>.</p>
