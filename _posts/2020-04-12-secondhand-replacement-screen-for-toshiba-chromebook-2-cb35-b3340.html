<p>Once I discovered the support window for a Toshiba Chromebook 2 (CB35-B3340) <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/11/old-chromebook-lifespan-longer-than-originally-thought/">extended longer than I had originally anticipated</a>, I was more willing to spend money to bring it back to working condition. While I was <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/03/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-replacement-screen-shopping/">shopping for a replacement screen earlier</a> I saw several offers for new units and a few scattered offers for secondhand units. I presume these were salvaged from retired machines and resold, which is fine by me as it came at a significant discount. <a href="https://amzn.to/3ehs7Gb">$47 with taxes and shipping</a> (*), as compared to $75 (before taxes &amp; shipping) for a new unit.</p>
<p>That ~40% discount also came with a caveat: I clicked "Buy" on a unit that was rated "Grade B: Fully functional but with visible blemishes." It was a bit of a gamble, but my primary requirement is only to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/01/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-developer-mode/">see enough to enter developer mode</a>, so I decided I would tolerate visual blemishes to save a few extra dollars. There was also a bit of a gamble in shipping. from <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/02/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-screen-removal/">my disassembly efforts</a> I knew this panel is very thin and fragile. This time around, I did not mind the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/09/one-amazon-order-three-identical-units-three-shipping-boxes/">extensive packaging of Amazon orders</a>.</p>
<p>I saw no physical blemishes on the panel during installation. Once installed, I was happy to see Chrome OS boot up and run. I had to work hard to see the visual blemishes that earned this panel its Grade B rating. I had to set the screen to full black, and artificially increase contrast in a photo editor, before we can see the magenta smudges: Two light horizontal smudges, and two dots one of which look a bit smeared.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with failure mode of LCD display modules so I have no idea what's going on here. Perhaps these were manufacturing defects? In any case, these flaws are only visible if I strain to look for them and there is no physical damage to the screen so I'm satisfied with my purchase.</p>

<p>The visual blemishes are not at all bothersome in normal usage. This level of performance was more than good enough to be used as a normal Chromebook if I wanted to use it as such. But the reason I got the screen was to access Chrome OS recovery menu to enter developer mode, so <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/13/developer-mode-and-crouton-on-toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340/">I will try that first</a>.</p>
