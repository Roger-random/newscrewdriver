<p>When I work on Sawppy, I test and run indoors. At <a href="https://dtla.makerfaire.com/">DTLA Maker Faire</a>Â Sawppy ran all over, both indoors and out. Most of the time people were playing with Sawppy on a piece of artificial turf at <a href="https://www.downtownla.com/explore/entertainment-arts-culture/parks-green-spaces/map/listings/maguire-gardens">Maguire Gardens</a>. This is an outdoor space where people would walk their dogs, raising obvious sanitation concerns running Sawppy on my home carpet after the event.</p>
<p>Well, after a long day of work, who doesn't enjoy kicking off their shoes and soaking their feet? I could give Sawppy the same royal treatment. All six wheels were removed and soaked in a tub filled with a mixture of water and household bleach. A retired toothbrush was used to scrub off dirt particles clinging to the wheel. Hopefully this removed most of the contaminants Sawppy might have picked up during the event.</p>

<p>It was also a good time to perform an inspection to see how Sawppy held up mechanically. In addition to the set screw mentioned yesterday, a few chassis mounting screws have fallen out and need to be replaced. I designed plenty of redundancy in these mounts so there was little risk of Sawppy falling apart.</p>

<p>After a few hours of soaking, the wheels were hung up to dry like old socks. What has six rover wheels but is not a rover? This laundry rack.</p>
