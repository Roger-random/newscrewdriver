<p>I came home from Sparklecon 2020 <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/19/dell-latitude-e6230-working-too-well-to-be-dismembered-nucc-to-the-rescue/">with several laptops</a> that had been awaiting reuse at <a href="https://www.nuccinc.org/">NUCC</a>. I took on the research project to determine the best way to put them to work. My primary goal was to turn them into robot brains, but I will need to keep my mind and eyes open for the best use. All three machines had depleted batteries, so I had no idea of their current condition.</p>
<p>I started with the bulkiest machine of the bunch, primarily because I could start charging its batteries with a Targus universal laptop AC adapter I already had on hand along with the H2 tip that seemed to fit charging jack dimensions. When I plugged it in, I saw an orange LED illuminate on the laptop and we were in business. The other two laptops appear to take Targus type I tip, currently on order via the "<a href="https://us.targus.com/pages/tips-from-targus">Tips from Targus</a>" program and I'll examine them after the adapter arrives and I could power them.</p>
<p>While I waited for some power to be put back into this flat battery, I wiped down the machine with a disinfectant wipe and examined the machine as I did so. I was surprised at the sparse text at the bottom of the machine. I would have expected to find a model number, FCC ID, the usual identifiers, but I only found a few cryptic alphanumeric designations. Fiddling with the various controls I found, I pushed a slider and the machine came apart in my hands. I panicked for a second before realizing this was supposed to happen.</p>

<p>This machine is a tablet/laptop convertible, and the screen could detach from its base. The bottom of the screen, previously blocked by the keyboard base, is where all the product identification information were. Now I can <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/21/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-hardware-specifications/">get started researching this device</a>.</p>
