<p>On the Hackaday.io project page of my <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/26840-luggable-pc-mark-ii">Luggable PC</a>, I wrote the following as part of my reason for undertaking the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>The laptop market has seen a great deal of innovation in form factors. From super thin-and-light convertible tablets to heavyweight expensive "Gamer Laptops." The latter pushes the limits of laptop form factor towards the desktop segment.</em></p>
<p><em>In contrast, the PC desktop market has not seen a similar level of innovation.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was true when I wrote it, and to the best of my knowledge it has continued to be the case. CES (Consumer Electronics Show) 2019 is underway and there are some pretty crazy gamer laptops getting launched, and I have heard nothing similar to my Luggable PC from a major computer maker.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-17619 alignright" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/laptops-aw-alienware-area-51m-nt-pdp-mod-hero.jpg" alt="laptops-aw-alienware-area-51m-nt-pdp-mod-hero" width="351" height="333">So what's new in 2019? A representative of current leading edge gamer laptop is the newly launched Dell <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/alienware-17-area51m-laptop">Alienware Area-51m</a>. It is a beast of a machine pushing ten pounds, almost half the weight of my luggable. Though granted that weight includes a battery for some duration of operation away from a plug, something my luggable lacks. It's not clear if that weight includes the AC power adapter, or possibly <em>adapters</em> plural since I see two power sockets in pictures. As the machine has not yet officially launched, there isn't yet an online manual for me to go read what that's about.</p>
<p>It offers impressive upgrade options for a laptop. Unlike most laptops, it uses a desktop CPU complete with a desktop motherboard processor socket. The memory and M.2 SSD are not huge surprises - they're fairly par for the course even in <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/03/in-a-distorted-computer-component-market-buying-is-better-than-building/">mid tier laptops</a>. What is a surprise is the separate detachable video card that can be upgraded, at least in theory. Unlike my luggable which takes standard desktop video cards, this machine takes a format I do not recognize. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/alienwares-new-area-51m-brings-a-new-design-rtx-gpus-and-9th-gen-intel-chips/">Ars Technica</a> said it is the "Dell Graphics Form Factor" which I had never heard of, and found no documentation for. I share Ars skepticism in the upgrade claims. Almost ten years ago I bought a 17-inch Dell laptop with a separate video card, and I never saw an upgrade option for it.</p>
<p>There are many different upgrade options for the 17" screen, but they are all 1080p displays. I found this curious - I would have expected a 4K option in this day and age. Or at least something like the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/08/13/lenovo-l24q-20-monitor-core-of-luggable-pc-mark-ii/">2560x1440 resolution of the monitor I used in Mark II</a>.</p>
<p>And finally - that price tag! It's an impressive piece of engineering, and obviously a low volume niche, but the starting price over $2,500 still came as a shock. While the current market prices may make more sense to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/03/in-a-distorted-computer-component-market-buying-is-better-than-building/">buy instead of building a mid-tier computer</a>, I could definitely build a high end luggable with specifications similar to the Alienware Area-51m for less.</p>
<p>I am clearly not the target demographic for this product, but it was still fun to look at.</body></html></p>
