These lights are widely available at very low cost from discount stores and dollar stores. My local 99-cent store sold a pair of lights for 99 cents.</p>
<p>The lights consist of the functional base, incorporating the battery, the switch, and the LED. It sits under the cosmetic shell, which is a cylinder pretending to be a candle with an unconvincing imitation flame above it. A little prying action should be sufficient to separate the shell from the base.</p>
<p>The unremarkable cosmetic shell can go in the trash. Then measure the diameter of the remaining base. Use that as a starting point: Go into Onshape and design a custom shell for that base.</p>
<p>My custom shell project started with a surface that describes a variant of the popular bathtub toy duck. It was not difficult to import the surface data into Onshape, but <em>making use</em> of the shape turned out to be more difficult than anticipated. Onshape surface manipulation tools aren't robust enough (yet?) to deal with arbitrary surfaces imported from elsewhere. In theory I can use the "thicken" command to turn the surface into a solid, but it and many related operations fail with a generic error message.</p>
<p>After some trial and error I found that the split operation works: Define a large rectangular solid, position it over the duck surface, and split the solid block into two: the duck and its negative. After deleting the negative, I have a solid duck shape.</p>
<p>In theory I can use the Onshape "hollow" tool to hollow out the duck shape, but again I was stymied by the error messages. To work around this problem, I started crafting shapes to manually carve out the interior. It didn't take terribly long to hollow out the bulk of the duck this way.</p>
<p>After sending the hollowed-out duck to my 3D printer, I was able to mate it with the LED light base and now I have a custom duck-shaped tea light!</p>
