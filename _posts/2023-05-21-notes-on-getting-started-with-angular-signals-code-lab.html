<p>As part of Google's I/O 2023 developer conference, they released several code labs that went with some of the talks. We can get a quick taste of new technology with these low-overhead exercises. I went through the WebGPU code lab out of curiosity to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/20/notes-on-your-first-webgpu-app-code-lab/">learn basics of modern GPU hardware programming</a>. In contrast, I went into <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/angular-signals">"<em>Getting Started with Angular Signals</em>"</a> with more than just curiosity. I had full expectation I'll learn stuff I can use in future Angular projects.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Project source code is set up for us to run in the browser (on <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/10/11/stackblitz-a-web-app-for-building-web-apps/">StackBlitz infrastructure</a>) with no need for local machine installation. Since I expect to use Angular Signals in future projects, I thought I'd clone the repo into my typical Angular environment: a Visual Studio dev container running locally. However, I ran into an error while running "<code>npm install</code>":</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code {"fontSize":"small"} --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code has-small-font-size"><code>While resolving: qgnioqqrg.github@0.0.0
Found: @angular/compiler@15.2.9
node_modules/@angular/compiler
  @angular/compiler@"^15.2.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @angular/compiler@"15.1.0-next.2" from @angular/compiler-cli@15.1.0-next.2
node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli
  dev @angular/compiler-cli@"15.1.0-next.2" from the root project</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This might have been easy to resolve with a little time, but StackBlitz was ready to go with no time. I decided to postpone debugging this situation until later and went through this code lab exercise on StackBlitz. It was fine, pretty much exactly what I saw in the video presentation associated with this code lab. We get to use <code>signal()</code> (the reactive piece of data), <code>computed()</code> (which reacts to other signal(s) and deliver its own reactive result) and <code>effect()</code> (which also reacts to other signal but does not deliver its own reactive result.) After going through Vue.js documentation recently, I recognize these as closely analogous to Vue's <code>data</code>, <code>computed</code>, and <code>watch</code>.</p>

<p>If that's all I got out of the code lab project, I would be disappointed because I hadn't learn anything in addition to what was covered in the video presentation. But unlike the video presentation, I have the rest of the project in hand for me to sink my teeth into. The first thing I wanted to investigate was the "Angular Standalone" concept, which I had thought was an advanced technique. But <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/19/notes-on-google-i-o-2023-angular-signals/">one of the Angular seesions at Google I/O</a> told me I was wrong: It was something intended to make Angular easier for beginners and small-scale projects. I should look into that! This Angular Signals code lab project makes use of <code>standalone:true</code> and I wanted to learn more. Fortunately for me, this code lab <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/22/notes-on-getting-started-with-standalone-components-code-lab/">linked to an earlier code lab</a> <em>Getting Started with Standalone Components</em>.</p>
