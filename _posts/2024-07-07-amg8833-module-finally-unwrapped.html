<p>I've been <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/07/06/adafruit-pycamera-library-includes-custom-ov5640-support/">learning CircuitPython library implementation for Adafruit Memento</a> (a.k.a. PyCamera) with the goal of doing something interesting beyond published examples. After brainstorming a few candidates, I decided to add an AMG8833 thermal sensor alongside. Mainly because I bought <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3538">an Adafruit breakout board</a> thinking it was neat and had yet to unwrap it. Today is the day.</p>

<p>According to my Adafruit order history, I bought this way back in 2018. Look at how faded that label has become. Over the past six years several project ideas had come and gone, the most recent one I can remember being an ESP32 web app like <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/01/as7341-project-future-enhancements/">what I had built for the AS7341</a> spectral/color sensor. But none of them got far enough for me to unwrap this roll of pink bubble wrap.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since the time I bought my sensor, Adafruit has added <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4469">a higher-resolution thermal sensor</a> to their product list. I told myself not to spend money on the newer fancier sensor until I actually use the one I had already bought. During this time Adafruit has also evolved the design, adding a STEMMA QT connector.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If I had one of the newer boards, I wouldn't need to do any soldering. The Memento has a STEMMA QT port and this little cable would connect them together.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But since I have the old board, I cut the cable in half so I can solder wires and plug the other end into Memento.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For mechanical mounting, I thought I would use one of the existing mounting holes and bolt it to a Memento corner post. It'd be quick and easy but unfortunately the hole diameter is <em>just </em>a tiny bit too small for this idea to work.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With that idea foiled, my brain started thinking about alternate approaches that grew more and more elaborate. I didn't want to invest in the time and effort because I didn't even know if this idea would work. I taped it down for the sake of expedient experimentation until a proof-of-concept first draft is up and running. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/07/08/adafruit-memento-amg8833-initial-bootstrap/">Time to start coding</a>.</p>
