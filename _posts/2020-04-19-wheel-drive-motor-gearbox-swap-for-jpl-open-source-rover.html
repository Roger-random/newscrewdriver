<p>It's a lot of fun to run the JPL Open Source Rover across rough terrain, seeing its rocker-bogie suspension system at work. But it is possible to play too rough and break some gears in the wheel drive gearbox. Some rover builders <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/jpl_opensource_rover/">on the forum</a> who ran into this problem decided they wanted sturdier motors and upgraded all six drive motors to something bigger and beefier. I understand this upgrade was done for the JPL-owned example as well. But that can be an expensive proposition.</p>
<p>If a rover is not strictly required to traverse rough terrain, we can decide to stay with kinder gentler terrain. Returning to the official parts list we see they are Pololu's <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/4888">item number 4888, 172:1 Metal Gearmotor LP 12V with 48 CPR Encoder</a>. As of this writing, $35 each. The easy solution is to buy more of them but I hunted for a less expensive proposition.</p>
<p>My first question is: "Can we make replacement gears?" and I quickly decided it was not practical. These gears are too small for consumer grade FDM 3D printers to handle and demands more strength than 3D-printed plastic can deliver. I don't have a machine shop with metal gear cutting equipment.</p>
<p>The next question is: "Can we buy replacement gears?" And I had no luck here as I didn't know how to navigate the manufacturing industry landscape to find who might be willing to sell small numbers of these gears to individual consumers.</p>
<p>Following that: "Can we buy replacement gearboxes?" The best I found was a company selling them with a minimum order quantity of 1000. I suppose I could buy a pallet and go into business selling replacement gearboxes to rover builders, but that's not my idea of entrepreneurship today. (UPDATE: While <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/jpl_opensource_rover/wheel-drive-motor-gearbox-repair-t191.html">sharing this information to OSR forums</a>, I <a href="https://amzn.to/3cwvMhL">found a vendor on Amazon</a>(*) selling them at $16 each. For lowest cost, I also <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Dc-Motor-Manufacturers-Engine-Reduction-Gearbox_62437392056.html">found a company on Alibaba</a> willing to sell individual gearboxes as samples at $2.79 each.)</p>
<p>What's left? Well, Pololu's product chart shows <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/3256">item 3256</a> is the same motor and gearbox, but without the encoder. As of this writing, these are $20 each, a significant discount for not buying another encoder.</p>
<p>It offers a lower cost alternative to direct replacement. I had two broken gearboxes on hand. They correspond to the two front wheels on a rover that took too big of a drop off a curb. I bought two #3256 gearmotors without encoder, and swapped their gearboxes out with the rover's two #4888 gearmotors with encoders, bringing the rover back up and running.</p>
