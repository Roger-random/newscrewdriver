<p>Today our <a href="http://sawppy.com">Sawppy</a> storyline on this blog has caught up to Sawppy version 1.0. The mechanical design for the six-wheel chassis has matured enough that it is a sufficiently functional platform for future projects. We still have mechanical tasks to do ahead of us: the camera mast still needs work, and Sawppy needs a robot arm like the real rovers. But the mechanical work will take a pause, so refinements in electrical design and software can catch up.</p>
<p>As part of declaring version 1.0, the assembly process has been <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/Sawppy_Rover/tree/master/docs">documented on Github</a> in the hopes that other people will build their own Sawppy. I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/29/sawppy-at-hackaday-la/">know there's interest</a> but I don't know how that interest will translate into action. It would be very rewarding for me to see other rovers running around.</p>
<p>The version 1.0 milestone also marks a time for housecleaning. I had been keeping all iterations of parts I've designed and printed on this project in a big bucket of fail. This is occasionally useful when I need to refer back to what I did for comparison to see if I'm actually improving the design. It was also useful to dig up for illustrating various posts on this blog as I tell Sawppy's story. Now that I've completed <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/Sawppy_Rover/tree/master/docs">documentation on Github</a> and told the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/projects/sawppy-the-rover/">story of Sawppy evolution on this blog</a>, it's time to discard them.</p>
<p>But before we do that, a big group picture of all the retired parts with Sawppy the Rover version 1.0.</p>
