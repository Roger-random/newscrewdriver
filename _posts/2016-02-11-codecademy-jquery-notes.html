<p>The "jQuery" class track was my first Codecademy class where everything is new to me. It was a lot of fun!</p>
<p>I'm very amused that the "new HTML" has ditched a lot of the mechanisms of the "old HTML" yet they're all together in one big bucket of HTML. There were input forms using the input fields that I had known before, but they don't bother with the form submit at the end. Entirely different script code is executed to replace the old-school form submit.</p>
<p>A whole lot of "new HTML" is hitched to the &lt;div&gt; element. Which, in the old world, does nothing. (That's not a sarcastic remark, read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/div">official specification</a>.) But with CSS and jQuery, the empty placeholder of a &lt;div&gt; becomes the starting point for visuals, actions, responses, all kinds of things impossible in old static HTML.</p>
<p>This was also the first Codecademy class that referenced API documentation for the class material. I was a little annoyed with the previous classes that lacked a pointer for students to get more information.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the class, they introduced jQuery UI, which is a separate library built on top of jQuery. I think the fact they were two separate entities deserved more emphasis, and the class didn't get into <em><strong>why</strong> </em>they were two separate things at all.</p>
<p>Once I understand how the design philosophies differ between the two, I will have an idea if I should look in one or the other for any specific thing I might be researching. But I don't have that yet! So I'll have to look in both places until I do.</p>
