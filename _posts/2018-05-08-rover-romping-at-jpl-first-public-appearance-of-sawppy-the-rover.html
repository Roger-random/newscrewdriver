<p>Today was the first public appearance of my next rover project: <a href="http://sawppy.com">Sawppy the Rover</a>. Well, the local maker group <a href="http://www.sgvhak.org/">SGVHAK</a> has seen Sawppy from prototypes of individual parts, but this is the first time it was shown to people I didn't already know.</p>
<p>The event was at <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">JPL</a> and Sawppy got to romp with its predecessors. The whole story starts with <a href="https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov">JPL's Open Source Rover</a> project serving as our baseline. In January, a team was formed from SGVHAK members to beta-test their assembly instructions and submit feedback. During the test/feedback/review process, I had the chance to talk with Eric Junkins of JPL. At some point Eric tossed out an idea that somebody might take this build-it-yourself rover concept in another direction and design a servo-powered, 3D-printed version.</p>
<p>After SGVHAK's rover project was complete, Eric's idea kept coming back up in my head. Eventually I decided that "somebody" will be me, so I started drawing up plans for a rover that uses <strong>s</strong>ervo-<strong>a</strong>ctuated <strong>w</strong>heels and 3D <strong>p</strong>rinted <strong>i</strong>nterconnects <strong>f</strong>or <strong>e</strong>xtrusions. Thinking like an engineer, at first I turned that description into an acronym: SAWPIFE. But then I turned that into the name Sawppy to make it more approachable.</p>
<p>Here's the rover lineup at JPL today: Eric is in the back (center) standing by his black &amp; red rover. SGVHAK's rover is the blue one in the middle, and Sawppy is the white rover sitting in the front right.</p>
<p>Today also marks the first public appearance of Sawppy online, albeit indirectly. I <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/05/08/how-to-build-anything-out-of-aluminum-extrusion-and-3d-printed-brackets/">wrote up my construction technique for Hackaday.com</a> and Sawppy served as cover model for that article. Sawppy is open for anyone to look over and maybe build their own, with its own <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/158208-sawppy-the-rover">Hackaday.io project page</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/Sawppy_Rover">Github repository</a> and a public <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/43678ef564a43281c83e1aef/w/392bbf8745395bc24367a35c/e/9bd6bbb7aba50a97523d14f2">Onshape CAD document</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next several days, this blog will detail adventures in building Sawppy the Rover.</p>
