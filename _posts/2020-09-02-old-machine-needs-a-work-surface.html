<p>My <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/26/first-project-prototype-has-poor-precision/">first prototype of a video-based measurement instrument</a> was a bit of a bust, as I discovered my motion control precision was poor and my camera can't resolve to the level of detail I wanted. But there's another problem: I don't have a working surface on this former 3D printer. For the initial test, I taped a ruler to the Y-axis carriage and that was enough to get some data, but the Y-axis carriage is not an adequate working surface given how it has protrusions from bolts holding Y-axis rollers and the ends of the Y-axis belt.</p>

<p>In a fully functioning Geeetech A10 3D printer, there is a heated print bed bolted to the Y-axis carriage. However, I got this machine in a partially disassembled state and I do not have that print bed or any of the associated hardware. Since I don't intend to use this as a 3D printer, I don't need a full-on replacement heated bed. So my replacement surface doesn't need an electric heater. I don't yet know if it'll be useful to have adjustments to level the bed, it will likely depend on the precision required by whatever project happens to be at hand.</p>

<p>To take the next step,  I need something relatively flat that is approximately the correct size. Digging through my graveyard of past projects, I found my candidate: the front panel from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/06/09/freenas-box-v1-prototype/" target="_blank">first draft of my FreeNAS box project</a>. Easily removed, as it was only taped in place. And since it had a rectangular slot cut in the middle already, it was easy to break off at the slot to form a roughly rectangular piece of acrylic at approximately the right size.</p>

<p>The pandemic has cut off my access to a laser cutter, so I could not cut holes for mounting bolts. Drilling brittle acrylic requires specialized drill bits or risk shattering the piece. While contemplating alternative ways to support this work surface, I started thinking it would be cool if these supports could be more than just spacers. What might I do to make it <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/03/a-weight-and-pressure-sensitive-work-surface/">a little smarter and more interesting</a>?</p>
