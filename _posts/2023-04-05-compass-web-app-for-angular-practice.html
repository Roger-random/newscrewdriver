<p>I've wanted to learn web development for years and one of my problems was that I lacked the dedication and focus to build my skill before I got distracted by something else. This is a problem because web development world moves so fast that, by the time I returned, the landscape has drastically changed with something new and shiny to attract my attention. When I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/04/04/window-shopping-polymer-and-lit/">window-shopped Polymer/Lit</a>, I was about to start the cycle again. But then I decided to back off for a few reasons.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First and most obvious is that I didn't yet know enough to fully leverage the advantages of web components in general, and Polymer/Lit in particular. They enable small lightweight fast web apps but only if the developer knows how to create a build pipeline to actually make it happen. I have yet to learn how to build optimization stages like tree-shaking and minimization. Without these tools, my projects would end up downloading far larger files intended for developer readability (comments, meaningful variable names, etc.) and include components I don't use. Doing so would defeat the intent of building something small lightweight.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That is closely related to the next factor: Angular framework has a ready setup of all of those things I have yet to master. Using Angular command line tools to build a new project boilerplate comes with a build pipeline that minimizes download size. I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/07/angular-material-impact-on-download-size/">wasn't terribly impressed</a> by my first test run of this pipeline, but since I don't yet know enough to setup my own, I definitely lack the skill to analyze why and certainly don't yet know enough to do better.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And finally, I have already invested some time into learning Angular. There may be some "sunk cost fallacy" involved here but I've decided I should get basic proficiency with one framework just so I have a baseline to compare against other frameworks. If I redirect focus to Polymer/Lit, I really don't know enough to understand its strengths and weaknesses against Angular or any other framework. How would I know if it lived up to "small lightweight fast" if I have nothing to compare it against?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hence my next project is to redo <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/30/visualizing-magnetometer-data-with-three-js/">my magnetometer web app</a> using Angular framework. Such a simple app wouldn't need all the power of Angular, but I wanted a simple practice run while things are still fresh in my mind. I thought about converting my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/01/as7341-project-future-enhancements/">AS7341 sensor web app</a> into an Angular app, but those files must be hosted on an ESP32 which has limited space. (Part of the task would be converting to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/18/hello-espasyncwebserver/">use ESPAsyncWebServer</a> which supports GZip-compressed files.) In comparison, a magnetometer app would be hosted via GitHub pages (due to https:// requirement of sensor API) and would not have such a hard size constraint. Simpler deployment tipped the scales here, so I am going with a compass app starting with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/04/06/angular-three-js-hello-world/">putting Three.js in an Angular boilerplate app</a>.</p>
