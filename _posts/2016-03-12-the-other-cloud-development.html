<p>When I set out on this adventure, I knew I wanted to eventually cover the basics of the major cloud services. Write some sample services to run on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developers/getting-started/">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/">Microsoft Azure</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google cloud services</a>, etc.</p>
<p>I was surprised to stumble into an entirely different meaning of "cloud development": writing code in a browser. I had seen the educational coding playgrounds of Codecademy, and I had seen small trial tools like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>, but I had no idea that was just the tip of the iceberg and things can get much fancier.</p>
<p>I had started a project to practice my newly-learned jQuery skills. Just with <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">a text editor</a> on my computer and running the HTML straight off the file system. As soon as I learned of these web-based development environments I wanted to try it out by moving my project over.</p>
<p>The first I tried was <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, whose whitepapers are quite grandiose in what it offers for improving developer productivity. Unfortunately the kind of development Codenvy supports aren't the kind of things I know anything about today. But I'll revisit in a few weeks to check again.</p>
<p>The second I tried was <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud 9</a>, which does support simple HTML+CSS+JS projects like what I wanted to do. Working in Cloud 9 gave me some tools for static analysis and serving my file off a real web server. It also integrates into Github preserving my source control workflow.</p>
<p>After a JavaScript project of around 300 lines of code, I can comfortably say I'm quite impressed. In the areas of development-time tooling and integration experience, it far exceeded my expectations. However, there was an area of disappointment: the debugging experience was either hard to find or just wasn't there at all.</p>
<p>When my little project goes awry, I resorted to loading up the project in a separate browser window and using the web browser debugger. This is on par with the simpler tools like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle </a>and <a href="https://jsbin.com">JSBin</a>. I had hoped for better.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously optimistic I'll find a tool with better debugging experience as I continue to explore.</p>
