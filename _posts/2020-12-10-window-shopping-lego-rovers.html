<!-- wp:paragraph --><html><body></p>
<p>After seeing circuit boards being used as structural members in the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/12/09/window-shopping-4tronix-m-a-r-s-rover/">4tronix M.A.R.S. rover</a>, I realized that I had forgotten a very fertile field: LEGO! My interest in mechanical systems today is something I give full credit to the LEGO sets I had growing up. My LEGO creations grew more complex as I grew older, limited only by my toy budget. However, once I got <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2016/07/04/entering-the-world-of-3d-printing/" target="_blank">up and running on 3D printing</a> objects of my imaginations, I haven't touched my big box of LEGO since. I quite enjoy the freedom of not being constrained by what LEGO pieces are available.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Among currently available LEGO sets, there is a tiny little Mars rover as part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mars-research-shuttle-60226" target="_blank">LEGO CITY Mars Research Shuttle (60226)</a>. The set is quite affordable, but about the only thing its little rover has resembling Curiosity rover are the number of wheels. Beyond that, there is no rocker-bogie and no corner steering, which is not a surprise at this price point.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Moving up the price and complexity scale is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/21104" target="_blank">LEGO NASA Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover (21104)</a>, released in 2014 and no longer in production. This was part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ideas.lego.com/" target="_blank">LEGO Ideas</a> program where people can submit their LEGO designs and, if enough other LEGO fans voted in favor, the LEGO group will consider adapting it for production. This particular idea <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/a2c285f9-9a6b-49ae-a834-c3c7e938e093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received over 10,000 supporting votes</a> and became an official product. Perusing its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/6083687.pdf" target="_blank">assembly instruction PDF</a>, I was surprised to find that this rover has a fully articulating rocker-bogie suspension. Very impressive! I also sadly learned that it required several pieces that I lack in my own LEGO collection, so I couldn't "just" follow the directions to build one of my own. At some point I could go hunt for the few missing pieces which should be cheaper than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=LEGO+21104" target="_blank">buying this out-of-production kit on eBay</a>. People are asking over $100 for a used kit and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/LEGO-21104-NASA-Mars-Curiosity-Rover-Retired-New-and-still-sealed/293874985253" target="_blank">as much as $1,100</a> for a never-opened box. That's more than two Sawppy rovers!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But if price is no object, I can look to other LEGO creations people have posted. There are quite a few "LEGO rover" projects online, and it follows roughly the same trajectory as the past few window shopping posts: most don't even have six wheels, some have six wheel rocker-bogie but no corner steering, etc.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An example of a rover with corner steering is this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://battlebricks.com/curiosity/" target="_blank">LEGO MINDSTORM NXT creation</a>. Despite being constrained by the selection of available LEGO pieces, it nevertheless replicated some features that I skipped with my 3D-printed rover. One example being the spokes in each of the six wheels, which I had simplified for 3D printing but the builder here faithfully represented more of the curves. And they have a robot arm, which my Sawppy is still waiting for. But according to the text, only the four corner wheels drive leaving the middle wheels free-wheeling. And it's not obvious if the rocker-bogie articulates faithfully. At the very minimum, this design is missing the differential bar across the top.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This rover looks to be roughly the same size as my Sawppy rover, but the price tag would be significantly higher. There are six visible NXT brains on this invention: five on board the rover and one for the handheld remote. Each $350 MINDSTORM NXT box comes with a single NXT brain, so this rover costs at a minimum 6 * $350 = $2,100 dollars. Yikes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So as far as LEGO rovers go, the best ones that implement features I consider important are build-it-yourself designs by enthusiasts and not available as commercial products. Thus we return to the world of 3D printing, where Sawppy <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/12/11/quick-look-jakob-krantz-mars-rover/">isn't the only rover design floating around</a>.</p>
