<p>I'm glad <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/03/notes-on-understanding-angular/">I skimmed through "Understanding Angular" documentation section</a> before going through "Tour of Heroes" tutorial for the second time. Combined with my improved understanding of web development, this time I actually understood everything covered in the tutorial. The best example are Angular directives, which were mysterious black boxes the first time around. I copied them straight from tutorial text without much comprehension of what they did. This time around, I mostly understood how they dictated Angular behavior. I also understood that some of what I see are shorthand versions and, if I get too lost, I can go look for their expanded-out full versions which are more explicit in their actions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I Know Where Things Go Now</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<p>One memory I had of my first run of "Tour of Heroes" were a few steps where the instruction was to copy a snippet of code into a specific file. However, they didn't say <em>where </em>in the file. The first time as a beginner, I didn't even understand enough to know where a code snippet should fit. This time around, I never felt that way. When a code snippet is presented, I understood the context where it should be inserted. This was a very satisfying feeling! Once I completed "Tour of Heroes" for the second time (which also went much faster) I had a selection of topics to explore outside the scope of the tutorial.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Need to Revisit Angular Tests</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One candidate is testing. At the moment I'm completely ignorant about automated testing of web apps. I know such tools exist, but so far, my web app projects were tested manually when I played around with what I wrote. As my project size grows (and I have ambitions of bigger projects) this approach would not scale well. Angular has provisions for testing frameworks, which we can kick off with "ng test". Angular boilerplate includes a bare-bones test (filename ending with spec.ts) that went with the corresponding code (filename ending with just .ts.) Since the tutorial only changed code file without updating its corresponding test file, I ran "ng test" expecting to see test failures. But it appears I have some work to do before I even get that far, because I'm running Angular inside a VSCode dev container, and it doesn't have Chrome installed.</p>

<p>I know it is possible to run Chrome in an automated test where it runs without any user interaction or even a visible interface. I'll need to figure out this "headless mode" before I can run "ng test".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After a few minutes of looking around online, it appears running headless Chrome inside a container requires more knowledge than I have at the moment. Instead of tackling another new thing, I decided to practice what I've already learned. I will resume <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/12/01/learning-plan-for-angular-round-2/" target="_blank">my tentative learning plan</a>, which calls for me to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/05/first-css-exercise-with-angular-tour-of-heroes-tutorial/">turn my Tour of Heroes into a CSS exercise</a>.</p>
