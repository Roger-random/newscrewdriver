<p>In the single-board computer field, the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3</a> has been the benchmark for high performance devices: A newcomer SBC has to provably outperform the Pi 3 to build a compelling case on superior performance. One big asterisk in these comparisons is the thermal conditions during comparison. When run hard, a default stock Raspberry Pi 3 can drive itself up to the self-imposed thermal limit of 85 degrees Celsius, at which point it throttles performance.</p>
<p>The BeagleBoard people has released their smallest form factor yet - the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/pocket">PocketBeagle</a>. Performance of their standard sized BeagleBoard are not thermally constrained like the Pi 3. But their claims of BeagleBone level of performance in a small form factor leads to the question whether packing into a tiny space also increased the thermal load. And if so, perhaps a heat sink will help performance as it would on a Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
<p>For this test, we ran a PocketBeagle at 100% CPU using the 'stress' tool available as part of its Debian distribution and measured its temperature with a non-contact infrared thermometer over a period of six minutes. The ambient air temperature was 28° C. Two runs were performed, and their average value plotted out against time (in number of seconds).</p>

<p>The temperature rise visibly started to taper off at six minutes. Gauging by the trend, it may approach but is unlikely to surpass 60° C. The Octavo <a href="https://octavosystems.com/docs/osd335x-sm-datasheet/">OSD335x datasheet</a> page 28 listed the operating temperature range of 0 to 85°C. We have plenty of thermal headroom on a PocketBeagle without use of any heat sinks when operating at normal room temperature.</p>
<p>Perhaps a PocketBeagle would need a heat sink in some high-temperature environments, but for normal use, anybody trying to sell a heat sink to improve performance is probably just selling snake oil. The thermal profile here is not anything like a Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
