<p>During an online video meetup with some makers, I learned that consumer-level ultrasonic knives exist. One member of the meetup was taking theirs apart for some reason I've now forgotten, I just remembered his quick demo of the handheld cutting blade cutting through a 3mm thick sheet of acrylic. It wasn't exactly "hot knife through butter" (maybe cold knife through refrigerated butter) but certainly far superior to what I could do with my X-Acto #11 blade.</p>

<p>I had known of ultrasonic tools in the medical field, specifically dental tools. I also had some idea they existed in the realm of industrial manufacturing equipment. But something I could conceivably buy for my own workbench? That's news to me. Unfortunately, the person on the video wasn't able to give me much information to go on, so I started searching for "ultrasonic knife" from my usual list of tool vendors. Unsurprisingly, I got a hit at McMaster-Carr: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mcmaster.com/3415N11/" target="_blank">Item #3415N11 Fast-Cutting Ultrasonic Precision Knife</a>. Visually, this looks like the same device I saw being disassembled at the meetup. But McMaster-Carr didn't give me very much information on this device, not even some things I consider basic like make and model for further evaluation.</p>

<p>A search for "Ultrasonic Knife" on Amazon would give me several multi-thousand-dollar industrial machines, and also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3uxzZwp" target="_blank">this listing</a>. (*) Titled "The Wondercutter S" it looks right, but this listing felt odd for several reasons. The brand is listed as "MICRO-MAKE" but there's nothing else by that brand name. There is also a logo on the device absent from the McMaster-Carr listing. It is stylized so I couldn't quite decipher it to letters, but it is definitely neither "Wondercutter" or "MICRO-MAKE". This listing didn't give me the confidence I needed to commit several hundred dollars, despite Amazon Prime guarantees.</p>

<p>Continuing online search, I also got <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/CUTRA-The-Wondercutter-Ultrasonic-Cutter-WC40000F25W/310788932" target="_blank">a hit at Home Depot</a> which was a mild surprise. I had not associated the big orange DIY home improvement store with high tech tools. From this listing I got a brand name "CUTRA" which explains the stylized logo I couldn't read earlier.</p>

<p>Now that I have a brand name, I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cutra.tradekorea.com/" target="_blank">its company site</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.wondercutter.com/" target="_blank">their own product site</a>. It appears to be a Korean company and I finally got the specifications I could sink my teeth into. There were also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.wondercutter.com/cutting-test/" target="_blank">a lot of demonstrations videos</a> on what this device could do, the one that got my attention was cleaning up supports for 3D printing. I've never enjoyed cleaning up supports, and I've had a few dangerous close calls with my trusty X-Acto blade doing so. A couple of hundred dollars is a significant investment, but if it saves me a single hospital visit that would make the item worthwhile.</p>

<p>From this site I also learned that Wondercutter was crowdfunded <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/wondercutter-40-000-ultrasonic-vibrations-per-sec#/" target="_blank">as an Indiegogo project</a> back in 2017. Well, I definitely missed the early bird backer special of $258 USD! I just have to pay retail now. Elsewhere on the site I saw I could order direct from Korea, but they have signed an official distributor for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.micromark.com/Wondercutter" target="_blank">United States: Micro-Mark</a>. Now this is a name I know from my scale plastic model days! I used to be a <em>very good</em> Micro-Mark customer buying Tamiya paints (they've all since dried out) and small model-building hand tools (I still use some of them).</p>

<p>Well, at least this explains the mystery branding of "Micro-Make" on that Amazon listing, it was a typo of Micro-Mark. There is actually a <a href="https://amzn.to/3qFHKyX">Micro-Mark storefront on Amazon</a> (*), but with only a subset of the full catalog. For example, they sell <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3uAXtk9" target="_blank">replacement Wondercutter blades</a> (*) but they don't sell the Wondercutter itself on Amazon. Why would they leave it open for an imposter vendor to take away potential Amazon sales? That's a curious business decision. Micro-Mark claims to be the exclusive distributor for North America, and I can see they are listed as vendors <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/The-Wondercutter-S/693741695">on sites like Walmart</a>. But I'm not sure what's the point of going through Walmart (or Home Depot or Amazon) if Micro-Mark is actually the distributor. It seems to make more sense to order one direct from Micro-Mark's own website.</p>
