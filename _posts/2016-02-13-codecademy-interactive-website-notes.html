<p>I left the Codecademy "<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-an-interactive-website">Interactive Website</a>" class irritated.</p>
<p>In their "Make a Website" class, it was a fun overview of HTML and CSS by building a specific project. No previous knowledge required. If people want, they can then go into the "HTML &amp; CSS" track and learn in more depth.</p>
<p>I thought "Interactive Website" would work the same way, an introduction to the JavaScript and jQuery classes with no prior knowledge required.  But the first interactive exercise felt otherwise: It asks the student to create a program skeleton by writing a JavaScript function, which beginners coming straight from "Make a Website" class wouldn't know how to do.</p>
<p>I thought to myself "Huh, this feels out of sequence. I'll go through some other classes and come back later." I went through the JavaScript and jQuery classes before returning. After I got past that first exercise, I saw the rest of the "Interactive Website" actually <em><strong>does</strong> </em>introduce beginner concepts for JavaScript. Such as: how to write a function.</p>
<p>Why does the first exercise require knowledge people wouldn't learn until later in that class? That feels like a poor way to structure the class. Looking in the forums, I saw I was not the only one. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/forum_questions/55a1b47b9113cb15de0000b5">Several other people complained</a> about the class structure, dating back several months.</p>
<p>Sometimes I  get reinforcement that I get what I paid for. Ah well, time to shrug it off and move on.</p>
