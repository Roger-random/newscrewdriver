<p>The first of three old laptops from <a href="https://www.nuccinc.org/">NUCC</a> to be examined stumped me at first. I found very little information printed on the device and it took a while before I realized <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/20/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-charge-and-split/">it was a convertible tablet</a>. All the information labels were hidden while the tablet was docked. Once I separated the pieces, I could read all the identifiers including its model number 13-r010dx. From there it was easy to find <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-pavilion-13-r000-x2-detachable-pc/6936232/model/7200388/product-info">HP's product page</a> for this machine.</p>
<p>While in laptop mode, the device has a full size SD memory card slot, one HDMI port, and two USB ports. By detaching the base turning it into a tablet, we also expose a duplicate charging jack, a headphone jack, and a microSD memory card slot. I find it odd that the headphone jack is a tablet mode exclusive, and even more odd that they felt it was important to have two flash memory slots.</p>
<p>For robot brain purposes I would have preferred to have a physical Ethernet jack but I can do without. USB Ethernet adapters are plentiful, though the ones I've tried had problems with long term reliability. On the upside, both memory card slots are full depth slots so cards sits flush against exterior and would not jut out. So for example, I could keep a microSD card in the tablet and still dock it to the keyboard base without mechanical interference. For robot brain purposes, memory cards are useful for data transfer and logging.</p>
<p>Keyboard feel is decent and the accompanying touchpad is satisfactorily large. Sadly the screen resolution was a disappointing 1366x768. It was accompanied by tablet style features like a touchscreen and a portrait/landscape orientation sensor. None of these would be critical as a robot brain but might be pertinent for other uses.</p>
<p>A sticker proclaimed its processor to be a Core i3, the spec sheet elaborated it is a <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/76608/intel-core-i3-4012y-processor-3m-cache-1-50-ghz.html">Core i3-4012Y</a> that I expect to be capable but not super speedy. 4GB of RAM should be sufficient for most purposes, and storage is a SATA hybrid hard drive with 500GB of spinning magnetic platter storage backed by 8GB of NAND Flash memory cache. I don't recall any prior experience with these hybrid drives and looking forward to seeing one in action. The charge port LED changed from orange to white indicating full charge by the time <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/22/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-up-and-running/">I was ready to turn it on</a>.</p>
