<p>I failed to find any LEGO VR titles, though that search did teach me there are ways to put existing non-VR games into VR headsets with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/03/window-shopping-vorpx/">a special video driver</a>. Maybe there'll be official LEGO licensed VR titles in the future [UPDATE: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjZG94IKHtc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future has arrived</a>] but if that's something I really want now, there are several LEGO-adjacent VR titles.</p>

<p>The most obvious is Minecraft, which has frequently been described as a digital-native counterpart to LEGO. Looks like there's a way to explore and build Minecraft worlds <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/vr" target="_blank">with a VR client</a>. Based on the screenshots I found, it doesn't look like they changed the game very much for this VR adaptation. In other words, probably not much more than running a standard client under vorpX.</p>

<p>Minecraft may have transferred a lot of LEGO ethos to the digital world, but it doesn't look much like actual LEGO pieces. BricksVR is much more LEGO-like in its bricks, and has a great deal focus on multiplayer online activities. Both in terms of sharing creations online and in terms of multiplayer interactions. Building together, exploring built creations together, and looks like they even have brick-based multiplayer mini games.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614920/BricksVR/">SteamVR version of BricksVR</a> has been discontinued, purportedly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1614920/discussions/0/3780246883317553087/" target="_blank">due to low player count</a>. This is now <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4018602774873329">exclusive to the Oculus ecosystem</a>. The game is still under development (it was "Early Access" on Steam before taken offline, and is still in "App Lab" for Oculus) so maybe they just wanted to focus on one platform while they get things nailed down. Perhaps they're trying to hook into Meta's whole Metaverse thing? I don't know. What I do know is that, unless I want to shell out a couple hundred bucks for an Oculus headset, BricksVR is out of my reach.</p>

<p>In contrast, Brickbuilder VR (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1665570/Brickbuilder_VR/" target="_blank">also "Early Access" on Steam</a>) looks much more interesting. It doesn't seem to have the multiplayer capabilities of BricksVR, but it has something much more interesting to me: LEGO Technics style of hardware creations. Look at this screenshot from the Steam store page for Brickbuilder VR:</p>

<p>I see gears, I see axles, I see levers, I see linear motion rails. Even a virtual remote control for a motor, currently active on Channel 1. Promotional material for Brickbuilder VR also included footage of a clock, a model of a steam locomotive, and other "functional" machinery. This looks really cool! The Steam reviews, unfortunately, made it clear Brickbuilder VR still needs more bake time. Many reports of crashes and other undesirable behavior, and its VR interface is still under-developed. Ah well, I can keep an eye on it to see if it matures into something interesting.</p>

<p>What about "if you want it done, do it yourself"? I briefly toyed with the idea of building my own LEGO VR experiment. Many foundational pieces are already in place, but <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/06/idea-unity-lego-microgame-in-vr/">things get complicated quickly</a>.</p>

<p>[UPDATE: After writing the above, search engines picked up on my interest and showed me links toÂ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/@brickmastervr6366" target="_blank">BrickMasterVR</a>, another brick-building VR title currently under development.]</p>
