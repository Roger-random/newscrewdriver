<p>With just two minor bugs in Nyan Cat both centered around power management, I'm content to leave them for later (if ever.) And it's not like I have any way to patch all the badges out there... we don't exactly have a badge counterpart to Windows Update. I'm going to finish documenting this project and move on to the next.</p>
<p>The first item is to <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/162253">create a page on Hackaday.io about this project</a>. I've had several projects where I documented in parallel on Hackaday.io and here, but Nyan Cat was a rush job and I couldn't spare the time. That project page will focus on the Nyan Cat specifically, so for example it won't have the blog entries about exploring hardware features of the Belgrade badge.</p>

<p>The second item is to dip my toes in YouTube video content creation. I'm setting low expectations on my first effort. A short script was written beforehand but I still stumble over a few words <em>and</em> the delivery is a bit wooden. The camera is fixed and looking straight down at the badge. The biggest problem turned out to be lighting, I have not yet figured out the camera settings required to have it do a faithful translation of colors on screen. (I had the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/11/13/supercon-2017-badge-film-in-the-back-alley/">exact same problem a year ago</a>.)</p>
<p>It's not great, but the best way to get better is to learn by doing!</p>
