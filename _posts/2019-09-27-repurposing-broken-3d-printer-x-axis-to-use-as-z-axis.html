<p>It feels like a lot longer than three years ago, but that's when I started my adventures in 3D printing <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2016/07/04/entering-the-world-of-3d-printing/">with the Monoprice Select Mini</a> 3D Printer. It was limited in print volume and print quality, but it served as a good introduction to 3D printing so I felt I understood the field enough to invest in <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/02/09/my-monoprice-3d-printers-at-february-2019-rssc-meeting/">larger and more capable printers</a>.</p>
<p>My Mini was retired from active duty and sat in a box until I loaned it out to Emily for the exact same purpose of giving her an introduction to 3D printing. And just as I did, the introduction led her to purchase a larger printer and my mini went back into its box.</p>
<p>Now it has been pulled out of the box for a third tour of duty elsewhere. This time, I am trading it away. It is destined for local technology outreach events, and in exchange for my working but limited printer I'm receiving a non-working Monoprice Mini to tear apart. Here is my printer performing <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:923108">a test print</a> to verify it still works, the final print it will perform in my possession.</p>

<p>Before I agreed to this trade, I was ready to tear it apart for the sake of extracting its X-axis. That black horizontal arm is a small self-contained linear actuation unit: it has a standard stepper motor, guide rods with linear bearings, and a belt-controlled carriage. Plus a micro switch for axis homing, all inside an integrated stamped sheet metal unit.</p>
<p>I wanted to use this X-axis assembly as the Z-axis for our Grbl CNC project. And the timing of this trade is fortuitous, because now I'm not destroying a perfectly working printer. It is not going to be rigid enough to handle a CNC cutting tool, merely an incremental upgrade over the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/09/18/quick-fabrication-for-servo-z-axis/">servo-controlled Z-axis</a>. This allows us to take our first step towards a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/09/28/wiring-z-axis-assembly-to-stepper-driver/">stepper-controlled Z-axis</a> for our machine.</p>
