<img class=" size-medium wp-image-3072 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cucumberlogo.png?w=600" alt="cucumberlogo" width="300" height="81">My new concept of the day: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior Driven Development</a>. As this beginner understands the concept, the ideal is that the plain-English customer demands on the software is formalized <em>just enough</em> to make it a part of automated testing. In hindsight, a perfectly logical extension of Test-Driven Development concepts, which started as QA demands on software treated as the horse instead of the cart. I think BDD can be a pretty fantastic concept, but I haven't seen enough to decide if I like the current state of the art in execution.</p>
<p>I stumbled into this entirely by accident. As a follow-up to the Rails Tutorial project, I took a closer look at one corner of the sample app. The image upload feature of the sample app used a gem called <a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave">carrierwave</a> uploader to do most of the work. In the context of the tutorial, CarrierWave was a magic black box that was pulled in and used without much explanation. I wanted to better understand the features (and limitations) of CarrierWave for use (or not) in my own projects.</p>
<p>As is typical of open-source projects, the documentation that exists is relatively thin and occasionally backed by the disclaimer "for more details, see source code." I prefer better documentation up front but I thought: whatever, I'm a programmer, I can handle code spelunking. It should be a good exercise anyway.</p>
<p>Since I was exploring, I decided to poke my head into the first (alphabetically sorted) directory : /features/. And I was immediately puzzled by the files I read. The language is too formal to be conversational English for human beings, but too informal to be a programming language as I knew one. Some amount of Google-assisted research led me to the web site for <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a>, the BDD tool used by the developers of CarrierWave.</p>
<p>That journey was fun, illuminating, and I haven't even learned anything about CarrierWave itself yet!</body></html></p>
