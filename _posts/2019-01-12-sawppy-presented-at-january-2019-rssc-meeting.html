<p>Today I introduced my rover project Sawppy to members of <a href="https://www.rssc.org/">Robotics Society of Southern California</a>. Before the presentations started, Sawppy sat on a table so interested people can come by for a closer look. My visual aid PowerPoint slide deck <a href="https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ak-SQhDpVdvoloAVocbMb-YTPUXgxg">is available here</a>.</p>

<p>My presentation is an extended version of what I gave at Downtown LA Mini Maker Faire. Some of the addition came at the beginning: this time I'm not following a JPL Open Source Rover presentation, so I had to give people the background story on ROV-E, JPL OSR, and SGVHAK rover to properly explain Sawppy's inspiration. Some of the addition came at the end: there were some technical details that I was able to discuss with a technical audience. (I'll expand on them in future blog posts.)</p>
<p>I was very happy at the positive reception I received for Sawppy. The first talk of the morning covered autonomous robots, so I was afraid the audience would look down at Sawppy's lack of autonomy. Thankfully that did not turn out to be a big deal. Many were impressed by the mechanical design and construction. Quite a few were also appreciative when I stressed my emphasis on keeping Sawppy affordable and accessible. In the Q&amp;A session we covered a few issues that had easy solutions... if one had a metalworking machine shop. I insisted that Sawppy could be built without a machine shop, and that's why I made some of the design decisions I did.</p>
<p>A few people were not aware of Onshape and my presentation stirred their interest to look into it. There was also a surprising level of interest in my mention of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/24/monoprice-maker-select-wanhao-duplicator-i3-as-rover-workhorse/">Monoprice Maker Select v2</a> as an affordable entry level 3D printer, enough hands were raised that I signed up to give a future talk about my experience.</p>
