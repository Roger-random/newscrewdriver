<p>I've been aware that the performance of an old HP Pavilion Split X2 (13-r010dx) is constrained by its hard drive to some degree. But when I tried to remove that constraint by upgrading it to a commodity SATA SSD, I found that it did not use the connector type I was familiar with. Rather, it used <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/23/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-sata-but-not-as-i-know-it/">a much thinner and rarer variant called SFF-8784</a>. Native SFF-8784 drives are expensive due to their low volume, but I found an Amazon vendor selling SFF-8784 adapter circuit boards to use mSATA or M.2 SATA SSDs. I resolved to come back to this project later, when I have a spare M.2 SATA SSD to try.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is now later. Thanks to some end-of-year sales, my computers received upgrades and the cascade of hand-me-down freed up a M.2 SATA SSD for this experiment. I proceeded to order <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/38oRlSK" target="_blank">the M.2 to SFF-8784 adapter board I found earlier</a> (*) eager to see how it might improve the old HP's responsiveness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first adapter arrived damaged. It was shipped in an anti-static bag and enclosed in a padded envelope. The padding was apparently not enough, because the M.2 connector was crushed out of shape. I doubted it would accept a M.2 SATA SSD and I didn't want to risk a perfectly functioning SSD to try.</p>

<p>I contacted Sintech and they sent a replacement. When the replacement arrived, I noticed a modification. It was still in an anti-static bag in a padded envelope, but there was the additional padding of a block of pink foam to protect the M.2 connector.</p>

<p>With the help of this pink foam block, the onboard M.2 connector survived shipping and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/11/examining-sintech-m-2-to-sff-8784-sata-adapter-st-ng8784/">looked good enough</a> for this SSD upgrade project to begin.</p>
