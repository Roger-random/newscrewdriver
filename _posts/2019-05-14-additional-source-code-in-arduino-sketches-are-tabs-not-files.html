<p>Being an electronics hardware tinkerer, there was no way for me to be ignorant about Arduino, but it never quite seemed to fit what I needed for a project: if I wanted computing power I used a Raspberry Pi, and if I wanted inexpensive low-level microcontroller I used a PIC. But I wanted to make Sawppy friendlier to beginners, and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/28/i-found-my-motivation-to-enter-world-of-arduino-make-sawppy-easier/">that was my motivation</a> to finally start learning about the Arduino ecosystem.</p>
<p>I understand Arduino's success is largely credited to how its creators underwent a clean-sheet examination at physical computing with the specific goal of making things easy for beginners to get started. A clean-sheet approach meant that tenure was meaningless. If the creators felt it was not helpful to beginners, it was gone regardless of whether it was a long standing tradition. I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/05/13/learning-how-to-write-arduino-libraries-and-tutorials/">read this philosophy repeatedly</a> as I was learning about Arduino, one example among many was this statement from Arduino API design style guide:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Some of these run counter to professional programming practice. We’re aware of that, but it’s what’s made it possible for so many beginners to get started with Arduino easily.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>After I felt I had done enough reading to feel like I was properly oriented, I embarked on my project to started writing code for driving Sawppy using an Arduino. It didn't even take 5 minutes before my well-worn habits ran into a collision with The Arduino Way. I wanted to put <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/JoyStick">joystick tutorial code</a> in its own header (<code>*.h</code>) and source (<code>*.cpp</code>) files instead of putting it in the top level sketch (<code>*.ino</code>) file... and I couldn't do it.</p>
<p>I selected "File"/"New" in the Arduino IDE, but that created a new Arduino sketch (<code>*.ino</code>). I poked around in various options on the file creation dialog, hoping to see a "create new header file" or similar, but saw nothing dealing with file types. I could see how file types might be confusing to beginners, so it's Arduino design in practice: avoid file types even if it disorients long time computer programmers.</p>
<p>And I was definitely disoriented. I was so stuck in my old ways I couldn't figure out what might have replaced it in Arduino IDE. I eventually found my answer by downloading an existing Arduino project with multiple source files and opening it in the IDE: additional source files are tabs! In the Arduino IDE, a "document" is a complete sketch with all its parts. If source code is spread across multiple files on disk, they are represented as tabs when the document was opened.</p>
<p>So in order to create a separate set of files for my joystick code, I need to select "New Tab" and give it the filenames I intended. One tab for <code>joydrive.</code>h and one for <code>joydrive.cpp</code>.</p>
<p>My relationship with Arduino is off to a rocky start, but I'm sure we'll work it out.</p>
