<p>After learning basics of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/29/cadquery-sketch-overview/">2D sketching in CadQuery</a>, I continued on to an overview of how CadQuery assembles <a href="https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assy.html">multiple parts into assemblies</a>. Many open-source CAD software focus only on making individual parts, providing no way to relate parts to each other. FreeCAD has the opposite problem: too many ways. Multiple competing FreeCAD assembly workbenches exist, leaving a beginner user confused. As of this writing, CadQuery has one and only one way to build assemblies, and I see that as an advantage over other alternatives.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The overview page starts with an example that was thin on explanation, fortunately it was there to set the stage for information that followed. Including a constraint solver that finds a way to mate parts together while satisfying all the specified constraints. It looks good on the surface but with three questions to be determined in the future:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>I will need some first hand experience before I understand constraint specification syntax, at first glance they are quite opaque but I expected that.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>During said first hand experience I'm sure I will run into errors. It remains to be seen how well I could understand those errors to find and fix their root cause. This is where FreeCAD failed me and I hope I have a better experience in CadQuery.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>And finally, I don't know computational performance of CadQuery constraint solver. The longer it takes between iterations, the more frustrating debugging will be.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We can assign different colors to each part in order to visually distinguish parts in an assembly. This is great, but I was surprised to see a complete color reference chart taking up a quarter of this document. It seems like a very large amount of space to convey relatively little information. I see my favorite HTML test color here: "aliceblue" and wonder if these are identical to HTML named colors. if so, there's even less need to duplicate that full color chart in CadQuery documentation. But I guess it doesn't hurt anybody by being here, so I shrug <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/05/01/exploring-cadquery-errors-via-examples/">and move on</a>.</p>
