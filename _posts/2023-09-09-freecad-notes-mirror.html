<p>FreeCAD offers <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/08/freecad-notes-distance/">multiple ways to constrain a distance</a>: strictly along vertical axis, strictly horizontal, or the shortest distance between those two points. This is more direct than Onshape's way of heuristically guessing user intent, and I can see myself learning to like it. What I will miss, though, is Onshape's sketch mirroring mechanism that can mirror along arbitrary lines and maintain relationship with the original. FreeCAD 0.20.2 doesn't seem to do either.</p>

<p>Many of my mechanical designs have symmetric features. Just as one example, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/12/26/notes-on-micro-servo-enclosure/" target="_blank">commodity micro servo</a> is mounted via two tabs, each held with a small screw. The mounting tab and screw hole is symmetric about the center. I prefer not to duplicate effort by drawing two tabs and two screw holes. In Onshape, i can draw just one side and a line on my sketch representing the center. I can then use the mirror function to generate the other side. If I need to refine my sketch later, I can fine tune dimensions on the side I drew and Onshape will automatically update the mirrored side to reflect my changes.</p>

<p>FreeCAD's Sketcher workbench does have a "Mirror Sketch" feature, but it does not mirror about arbitrary lines in the sketch. It can only mirror about the X axis, the Y axis, or the Origin point which mirrors both X and Y. Here I've sketched out one quarter of a symmetric part (Displayed jn green) and mirrored it three times (about X, about Y, and about Origin. Displayed in white.) to create the entire perimeter of this test.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Furthermore, I didn't get to select which feature to mirror. "Mirror Sketch" mirrors <em>everything </em>in the sketch and placed results in a new sketch, which seems to sever all association with the original sketch.</p>

<p>If I change a dimension in the original sketch, in this experiment the width, none of the mirrors were updated to reflect my change. There's a "Merge sketches" feature to put everything back into the same sketch, but that doesn't fix this problem.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's a good chance I can accomplish what I want with a different FreeCAD feature, much as how <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/09/07/freecad-notes-midpoint/" target="_blank">I wanted "Midpoint"</a> and eventually found a solution via "Constrain symmetrical". But as of this writing I haven't found my desired functionality. Until I do, sketching symmetric features in FreeCAD will require duplicate effort sketching features that I could mirror in Onshape. I will then have to manually link duplicated features with "Constrain equal" so any future updates to critical dimensions will be properly propagated through symmetric features. This will not be a major dealbreaker against using FreeCAD, just mildly annoyed at the extra effort taking more time.</p>
