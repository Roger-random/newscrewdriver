<!-- wp:paragraph --><html><body></p>
<p>Years ago at a past Hackaday Superconference, I had the chance to play with a small batch of "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.mrrobotbadge.tv/" target="_blank">Mr. Robot Badge</a>" that were deemed defective for one reason or another. After a long story that isn't relevant right now, I eventually ended up with a single unit from that batch with (at least) two dark LEDs in its 18x18=324 array of LEDs. I thought trying to fix it would be a good practice exercise for working with surface-mount electronics, and set it aside for later. I unearthed it again during a recent workshop cleanup and decided it was a good time to check my current surface mount skill level.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm missing a few tools that I thought would be useful, like a heat plate or hot air rework station. And while my skills are better than they were when I was originally gifted with the badge, it's still far from "skilled" at surface mount stuff. (SMD for surface-mount devices, or SMT for surface-mount technology.) One relatively new tool is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/07/04/backlight-led-tester/" target="_blank">dedicated LED tester</a>, and I used it to probe the two dark LEDs. One of them would illuminate with the test probe in place, and a dab of solder was enough to make proper electrical connection and bring it to life. The other one stayed dark even with test probe and would need to be replaced.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Looking in my pile of electronics for a suitable doner, I picked out my ESP32 dev module with a flawed voltage regulator that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/07/switching-to-esp32-for-next-exercise/" target="_blank">went up in smoke with 13V DC</a> input (when it should have been able to handle up to 15V DC). This module has a red LED for power and a blue LED for status. I probed the red LED and found it dead, but the blue LED lit up fine. Between "keep looking for a red LED" and "use the blue one in my hand" I chose the latter out of laziness. This is a practice exercise with low odds of success anyway.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Lacking a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/29/hot-air-station-amateur-hour/" target="_blank">hot air rework station</a> or a hot plate, I didn't have a good way to heat up both sides of a LED so there was a lot of clumsy application of solder and flux as I worked to remove the dead badge LED. It came apart in two pieces, so I practiced removal again with the dead red LED on my ESP32 dev module. Once I removed it intact, I tossed it aside and used my newfound (ha!) skill to successfully remove the blue LED in one piece. I might be getting the hang of this? Every LED removal was easier than the last, but I still think a hot air station would make this easier. After I cleaned up the badge LED pads, I was able to solder one side of the salvaged LED then the other. I could see a little bit of green on one side of the LED indicating polarity, so I lined it up to be consistent with the rest of the LEDs on the badge.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I turned on the badge and... the LED stayed dark. It then occurred to me I should have verified the polarity of the LED. Pulling out the LED tester again I confirmed I have soldered it on backwards. Valuable lesson: LED manufacturers are not consistent about how they used the little bit of green on a LED to indicate polarity. So now I get to practice LED removal once again, followed by soldering it back on the correct way. I would not have been surprised if the blue LED had failed after all this gross abuse. On the upside a failure would motivate me to go find another red LED somewhere.</p>

<p>Here is a closeup of the problematic area on the badge. The circle on the right was the LED that just needed a bit of solder for proper contact. The circle on the left represents the scorched disaster zone that resulted from SMT rework amateur hour as I unsoldered and resoldered multiple times. The little blue LED clung on to life through all this hardship I had inflicted and shone brightly when the badge was turned on. I'll call that a successful practice session.</p>

<p>[Update: I didn't originally intend to do anything with the badge beyond soldering practice, but I looked into trying to write my own code to run on the badge and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/04/15/programming-mr-robot-badge-mk-2-with-arduino/">successfully did so</a>.]</p>
