<p>I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/24/hard-drive-wd800-control-board/">looked over the control circuit board for a Western Digital WD800 hard drive</a> and failed to find any documentation relating to chips I found onboard. Oh well. Maybe I'll have better luck with another drive. For this drive, I continue on to familiar territory: take it apart to marvel at all those mechanical wonders within. As a side effect, this will also make all data stored on this drive functionally inaccessible.</p>

<p>The only tricky part with disassembly is that two of the Torx screws holding lid in place were hidden under the label sticker.</p>

<p>Inside we see a single platter. I'm pretty sure 2002 was recent enough for multi-platter drives, which would mean 80GB was not the highest capacity model in this product line even when it was new.</p>

<p>A translucent yellow bracket limits possible range of motion with read-write head. A small magnet is embedded on one end, but I don't know its design intent. Perhaps it held the head in place when there's no power? This bracket is held by a single screw and had to be removed before the read-write head can pivot far enough to clear the platter.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Visible in this picture under the read-write head voice coil is one of two very powerful magnets buried inside this hard drive, the other one is mirror-image on top and already removed in this picture. I have yet to figure out how to nicely separate the magnets from the thick steel cage they are glued(?) to.</p>

<p>Once cleared I could remove the read-write head and platter. There was a pleasant surprise when the platters were removed: I saw three more screws holding the motor in place. Previous HDD teardowns found motors press-fit into the aluminum and impractical to remove. This was the first brushless hard drive motor spindle I could easily remove and store away for potential future projects. Learning more about brushless DC motors is on my to-do list, and I will need motors to experiment with.</p>

<p>This is just the latest in a series of desktop-sized 3.5" HDD I've taken apart. What I haven't done much of is taking apart their <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/26/toshiba-2-5-250gb-sata-hdd-control-board-hdd2d90/">laptop-sized counterpart 2.5" HDD</a>.</p>
