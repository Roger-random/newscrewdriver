<img class=" size-medium wp-image-5269 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon_drive_logo.png?w=600" alt="Amazon_Drive_logo" width="300" height="80">I count myself as a skeptic of the new cloud-based world. When I first learned of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">DropBox </a>I wasn't willing to trust it with my data. When I read about the frustration of people whose data are still trapped on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload">MegaUpload</a>, Â I felt vindicated.</p>
<p>But the tide of progress moved forward and now we have many cloud-based storage providers with enough of a track record for me to dip my toes in the water. Starting in January 2016 I started using cloud-based storage for my personal needs, spreading my files across <a href="https://onedrive.live.com">Microsoft OneDrive</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive">Amazon Drive</a>.</p>
<p>That's not to say I trust cloud-based storage yet. I still maintain my regimen of home offline backups on removable hard drives. And for the files that I feel are important, I duplicate storage across at least two of the cloud storage providers.</p>
<p>Almost a year and a half in, I admit I see a lot of benefit. I've become a lot less dependent on a specific computer as much of my files are accessible from any computer with an internet connection. I can pick up work where I left off on another computer. I can refresh and reformat a computer with far less worry I'll destroy any irreplaceable data.</p>
<p>And then there are the wacky outliers. When I wanted to obtain a library card, one required proof of local residency is an utility bill. I was able to pull out my phone and retrieve a recent electric bill thanks to cloud storage.</p>
<p>But just like physical spinning hard drives, a failure is only a matter of time. And tonight, after almost 18 months of flawless cloud storage performance, we have our first winner. Or more accurately, our first loser. Tonight I was not able to access my files on Amazon Drive. I get the "Loading" spinner that never goes away.</p>
<p>The underlying Amazon storage infrastructure seems ok. (AWS S3 status is <a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/">green across the board</a>.) This must be a failure in their consumer-level storage offering, which will probably get fixed soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they have one annoyed customer.</body></html></p>
