<p>As of late August 2019, the official JPL Open Source Rover specifications call for <a href="https://www.batteryspace.com/li-ion-battery-14-8v-5-2ah-77wh-8a-rate-for-diving-light---un-38-3-passed.aspx">this battery pack</a>. Based on specifications listed on that page, it appears to be built from 18650 Lithium Ion battery cells in a 4S2P configuration. (4S2P means four cells in series, two sets of them in parallel, for a total of eight 18650 battery cells.) The key feature that made this pack <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/jpl_opensource_rover/length-of-the-tamiya-battery-connector-leads-too-s-t140-s10.html#p1081">desirable for JPL</a> is the extra safety it offers: this battery pack features an integrated battery protection circuit board backed up by a polyswitch. This is great protection against battery abuse such as over-charging and over-discharge including short circuits. Like many facilities working with leading edge engineering, JPL had its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-is-why-you-should-take-lithium-ion-battery-fires-v-1788281947">own experiences with runaway batteries</a> so it's no surprise they would recommended the safest thing available.</p>
<p>The safety, however, comes at significant cost as the pack costs over double that of a commodity battery pack popular with remote control vehicles. (Multi-rotor aircraft, monster trucks, etc.) And that's before factoring availability and its impact on shipping costs. The rover specifications already include a 10A fuse on board, plus a power monitoring module that can be programmed to sound an alert when the battery has been discharged too low. This provides a baseline level of protection so rover builders like myself can choose to forgo the belts-and-suspenders safety of a premium battery.</p>
<p>But in order to use commodity battery packs, we'll need a different battery tray, and that's where this project came in. It also makes the battery more easily accessible via a rear door for charging, replacement, or in the worst case scenario, yank it out of the rover quickly in an emergency.</p>
<p>This battery tray was designed for a <a href="https://amzn.to/2Bi1pLi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4S LiPo battery pack</a> (*) with a hard outer shell for physical impact protection, and the tray bolts on to the bottom plate of rover body. CAD file is an online <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/888690d1aa3078370aadc511/w/69f47c6adfe6b6fa8be13df6/e/b1e9bc394fd08152623f06c6">Onshape public document</a> for anyone to modify to suit different battery packs. For those who don't need to make modifications, ready-to-print STL (and DXF for updated rear panel) have been <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3880494">posted on Thingiverse</a>, and a video walkthrough has been posted to YouTube:</p>
