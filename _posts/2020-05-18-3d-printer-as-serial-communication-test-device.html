<p>Reading about <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/16/the-very-informative-c-programming-guide-for-asynchronous-programming/">novel programming patterns</a> and contemplating <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/17/xbox-one-is-part-of-universal-windows-platform/">unexpected hardware platform potential</a> are great... but none of it is real until I sit down and make some code run. Since my motivation centered around controlling external peripherals via serial port, I'll need a piece of hardware to experiment against. In the interest of reducing variables, I didn't want to start with one of my own past projects. I expect to run into enough headaches debugging what went wrong, I don't need to wonder if the problem is my code or my project hardware.</p>
<p>So what do I have sitting around at home that are serial controlled hardware? The easy answer is the brains of a 3D printer. And the most easily accessible item is my <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/Pulse">MatterHackers Pulse</a> XE printer, which is conveniently sitting on the same table as the computer.</p>
<p>In order to get an idea of what I'm getting into, I connected to the printer via serial port terminal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY">PuTTY</a>. I saw that a greeting message is sent out via serial as soon as I connected. This is great, because it meant I have some data to read immediately upon connect, no need to worry about sending a command before getting a response.</p>
<p>Moving to the development platform, I loaded up the UWP example program <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/CustomSerialDeviceAccess">Custom Serial Device Access</a>. After reading the source code to get a rough feel of what the application did, I compiled and ran it. It was able to enumerate the USB serial connection, but when I connect, I did not see the greeting message. Even though the parameters I used for PuTTY (250000 N 8 1) were also used here.</p>
<p>As tempting as it might have been to blame the example program and say it is wrong, I thought it was more likely that one of the other parameters of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.serialcommunication.serialdevice"><code>SerialDevice</code></a> had to be changed from their default value. Flipping settings one by one to see if they change behavior, I eventually figured out that I needed to set <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.serialcommunication.serialdevice.isdataterminalreadyenabled"><code>IsDataTerminalReadyEnabled</code></a> to <code>true</code> in order to receive data from a Pulse XE. I'm lucky it was only a single boolean value I had to change because if I had to change multiple values to a specific combination, there would have been too many possibilities to find by trial and error.</p>
<p>It's always good to start as simple as possible because I never know what seemingly basic issue would crop up. <code>IsDataTerminalReadyEnabled</code> wasn't even the only surprise I found, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/19/unexpected-behavior-serial-device-read-timeout-only-applies-when-theres-data/"><code>ReadTimeout</code> behavior was also unexpected</a>.</p>
