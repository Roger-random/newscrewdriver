<p>My 2004 Mazda RX-8 was factory equipped with an optional in-car navigation system, but the map data and the electronics behind it are now twenty years out of date. Potential upgrade ideas evolved over my two decades of ownership, but I never got around to any of them. Now <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/30/replacing-factory-navigation-for-2004-mazda-rx-8/">I've decided to give my car a modern (for now) capability</a>: connect to a phone via Apple CarPlay or Google's Android Auto.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A typical upgrade solution is to replace the factory stock audio head unit with an aftermarket unit. There's a large selection of CarPlay/Android Auto capable products, like this <a href="https://amzn.to/3YcJjEk">randomly chosen example Pioneer DMH-W2700NEX</a>. (*) Such replacement is relatively easy for dashboards that conform to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_head_unit#Size_standards">dual-DIN standard</a> for audio head units. Unfortunately, interior design has been moving away from that standardized format, a trend that included my car. Stylistically integrating audio with the rest of interior now hinders my attempted upgrade.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fortunately, the aftermarket has an answer for that as well, in the form of <a href="https://amzn.to/3OCqWp4">Metra 95-7510HG</a>. (*) This kit replaces the entire center console panel with a new facade that accommodates a dual-DIN head end. The "HG" suffix has a glossy finish that matches the stock panel, the version without "HG" prefix may blend in better with the rest of the interior which did not have a glossy finish. There's also a single-DIN variation with a little storage cubby, but that would be too small to accommodate a CarPlay/Android Auto touchscreen. In all cases, we lose the circle themed Mazda styling on the original panel.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The price tag on these kits is far more expensive than a plastic panel and a few brackets, because there's a fair bit of electronics that have to be installed as well. Remember that interior integration trend? This panel, formerly hosting the audio controls, also hosts the HVAC controls. Plus, sitting above this panel is a single glowing red screen displaying both HVAC and audio status. The Metra kit includes electronics to interface with the HVAC and status display. It also interfaces with the steering wheel audio controls. And finally, a critical safety item: the emergency flasher button is also part of this assembly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Searching on the RX-8 owner forum, I found many reports that the Metra kit is not a seamless experience.  There are complaints about mechanical fit, cosmetic finish, and electrical gremlins in the electronic interface translators. They're all solvable problems except for the last one: I don't usually look down that far when driving. My car already has a screen up high in my normal field of view. I want to use that location. Based on the above criteria, I decided against the Metra kit and will <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/01/standalone-carplay-android-auto-receivers-exist/">try a different route</a>.</p>
