<p>At a recent <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/xknvdlyxpbjc/">SGVTech meetup</a>, newcomer Amir had lots to offer. One item that I picked up on was his assertion that a <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/1500-watt-dual-temperature-heat-gun-5721112-62340.html">cheap Harbor Freight heat gun</a> can be a low-cost alternative to fancy electronics hot air rework stations. I have one of those cheap hot air guns in my garage! Designed for home improvement projects like paint stripping, it is a big crude tool. I wouldn't use it to assemble surface mount devices or anything I actually care about until I get a better idea of what I am doing. I'll learn to handle it by disassembling parts that are either robust, or that I don't care about.</p>
<p>The very next week, I got the chance to put that idea to the test when [<a href="https://twitter.com/MLE_Online">Emily</a>] and I felt inspired to try lighting up a CRT. The original driving electronics are no longer functional due to us <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/11/24/sony-kp-53s35-teardown/">crudely tearing them out of the TV</a>, but the tube and a few associated accessories are still intact. To help us play with the tube, we thought it might be a good idea to remove a CRT socket to make it easier to access our tube's pins. This is the ideal situation for testing the heat gun - a big socket should be robust enough to take the heat of a clumsily applied hot air gun much better than something delicate. This TV is also old enough to predate ROHS and lead-free solder, so we expect the solder to flow relatively easily.</p>
<p>I aimed the hot air gun at the solder joints at low setting. After a minute of inactivity, I turned it up to high. About a minute after that, we could see solder starting to melt. A few more seconds after that, all solder on the socket melted enough for us to remove it.</p>

<p>This was much faster and easier than individually undoing solder joints using a soldering iron and a solder removal tool. And the mission was successful: our newly freed socket made it easier to probe terminals and to make experimental connections with alligator clips.</p>
