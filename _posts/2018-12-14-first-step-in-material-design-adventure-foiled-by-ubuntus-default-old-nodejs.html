<p>With the decision to tackle a new web-based software project, the next decision is what web-based UI framework to build the app in. My last web-based software project was to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/04/30/a-fresh-start-for-sgvhak-rover-ui/">build an UI for SGVHAK rover</a> at the beginning of the year. In the fast-paced world of front-end web development, that's ancient history.</p>
<p>The rover UI project used <a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize CSS</a> library to create an interface that follows Google's <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a> guidelines. At the time, Google offered web developers a library called "Material Design Lite" but with the caveat they're revamping the entire web development experience. There was little point in climbing the learning curve for a deprecated library like MDL. As Materialize CSS was close to using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, a known quantity, the choice was appropriate for the situation.</p>
<p>Now, at the end of the year, we have Google's promised revamp in the form of <a href="https://material.io/develop/web/">Material Design Components for Web</a>. I am still a fan of Material so my signal generator utility project LRWave will be my learning project to use Google's new library.</p>
<p>Diving right into the <a href="https://material.io/develop/web/docs/getting-started/">Getting Started Guide</a> during a local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LearnTeachCode/events/nxnwmqyxqbmb/">coding meetup</a>, I got as far as the end of "Step 1" executing <code>npm start</code> when I ran into my first error :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>ERROR in ./app.scss</code><br />
<code>    Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token {</code><br />
<code>        at exports.runInThisContext (vm.js:53:16)</code><br />
<code>        at Module._compile (module.js:374:25)</code><br />
<code>        at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:417:10)</code><br />

<p>Since <code>app.scss</code> was only three lines for Step 1, it was trivial to verify there's no typo to account for an unexpected "{". A web search for this error message implicated an out-of-date installation of NodeJS, which triggered a memory from when I first started experimenting with NodeJS on my installation of Ubuntu 16.04. When trying to run <code>node</code> at the command line, a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 would tell the user:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>The program 'node' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:</code><br />
<code>sudo apt install nodejs-legacy</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That suffix "legacy" is a pretty good hint this thing is old. Running <code>node --version</code> returned v4.2.6. Checking the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node JS website</a>, today's LTS is v10.14.2 and latest is 11.4.0. So yes, 4.2.6 is super old! Fortunately there's a pointer to a <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md">more updated set of binaries maintained by Nodesource</a> that plays well with Ubuntu's built-in package management system. Following those directions automatically uninstalled legacy binaries and replaced them with up-to-date versions.</p>
<p>Once I'm running on non-ancient binaries, I could continue following MDC Web's Getting Started guide on my computer. But this experience motivated me to look into a different option...</body></html></p>
