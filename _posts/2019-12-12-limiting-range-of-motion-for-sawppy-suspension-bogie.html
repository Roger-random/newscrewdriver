<p>Sawppy's appearance at LA Maker Faire was also the first public trial of the latest feature: a way to limit the range of motion on Sawppy's suspension bogie assemblies. They were previously joints that were allowed to spin freely. I had known that the bogies shouldn't actually turn too far, because that would break the wires running out to the wheels. But I didn't think it would be a problem as long as Sawppy is rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>It turns out I was wrong. When Sawppy explores extreme terrain, it is possible for the bogie to tilt a little too far and gravity works the rest of the way and sprain a Sawppy ankle. I'm sure the actual rovers had a clever mechanism inside their bogie joint to limit their range of motion, but the details of their implementation aren't apparent from pictures.</p>
<p>Ideally I would redesign both parts of the bogie joint in a way to limit their range of motion, but I didn't want to reprint all the parts and recut a shaft just yet. For the first draft of this angle limiter, I changed the smaller part to add a nub that restricts the range of motion.</p>
<p>I originally wanted this nub to live underneath out of sight, but due to the angle of the suspension bogie, it turns out there's no place for such a nub underneath if I wanted to preserve the desired range of motion. So the nub lived above as a very visible difference between it and the rovers that inspired Sawppy.</p>
<p>The angle limiter did function properly during Downtown LA Maker Faire, but I'm not satisfied with its appearance. The part is available directly from <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/43678ef564a43281c83e1aef/w/392bbf8745395bc24367a35c/e/bc12cd957a8285083c1ffbad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sawppy's Onshape CAD file</a>, but I think there will be a few more iterations before I push it over to <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/Sawppy_Rover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sawppy Github</a>.</p>
