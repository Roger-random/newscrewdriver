<p>This Taylor food thermometer display went blank and stayed blank even when given fresh batteries, so it's getting the teardown treatment before disposal. It appears to be a design that the company has made for many years with slight variations, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3wOi9Yw" target="_blank">here is a close cousin I found on Amazon</a>. (*) I've found no mentions of repair instructions or replacement parts, this is a disposable device.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to check is construction of the temperature probe. There were two possibilities:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>The temperature probe is mostly metal, and the sensor is near where the wire is attached. This would be dependent on a metal with high heat conductivity to carry heat from the tip of the probe to the sensor at its base.</li>
<li>The temperature probe is mostly hollow tube, and wires run the entire length of the probe to a sensor at the tip.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I started opening it up and got this far before slicing myself open on a sharp metal edge.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With a ritual blood sacrifice to the teardown gods, I decided to stop here. It is far enough for me to conclude that possibility #2 is correct and the probe is mostly hollow tube with the sensor at the tip.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next I started prying against the shiny top surface of the device and found it was merely a cosmetic facade held on with glue and not hiding any fasteners underneath.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Four fasteners were visible behind the display so I started work there.</p>

<p>There is a piezo sound element embedded in the back, and a circuit board inside. Under that black blob is likely a chip that runs the whole show. What struck me are the areas to the left of the blob: there are a few round test points, but many more rectangular pads for components that aren't there. Are they for calibration? Are they for adjustment? Are they to activate/deactivate features for other products in the lineup? Maybe a combination of all of them?</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I see a single screw for the base. Removing that screw freed a small piece of plastic but did not free the entire base. However, it did let me see inside the base and distinct signs of additional fasteners.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aha, I forgot to check for fasteners hidden under squishy feet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With those screws removed, we can see the base has no active components. It has the battery enclosure, socket for the temperature probe, and a circuit board for all the switches and buttons to operate the device. All the components appear to be in good shape, I see no obvious signs of damage that might explain why the device stopped working.</p>

<p>The display is a custom LCD unit held on with the squishy conductive stuff I've seen before in tearing down electronics but didn't know anything about. This time I went online and found <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/157647/what-are-rubbery-conductive-strips-called-on-the-sides-of-an-lcd-screen">this electronics StackExchange thread</a>. Which <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/269255/mysterious-lcd-interface-without-wires">linked to this one</a>. Formally "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomeric_connector">Elastomeric connector</a>" and less formally "zebra strips" (though a search with those terms also need to have "electronic" in the keyword list or else we'd get stuff about zebra the animal.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":29446,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/taylor-food-thermometer-lcd-contacts.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-29446"></figure>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I don't plan on keeping the circuit board or any of the components on board, but I'll hang on to the LCD for the moment. If I get around to probing the LCD in the future I'll need to fabricate my own circuit board to make contact with the zebra strip. I can take this picture showing the connector pitch, but sadly I've already lost horizontal alignment reference and that'll be a problem I have to tackle later.</p>
