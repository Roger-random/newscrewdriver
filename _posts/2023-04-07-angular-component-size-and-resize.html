<p>For my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/04/06/angular-three-js-hello-world/">first attempt at getting Three.js running inside an Angular web app</a>, the target element's width and height were hard coded to a number of pixels to make things easier. But if I want to make a more polished app, I need to make this element fit properly within an overall application layout. Layout is one of the things Angular defers to standard CSS. Translating layouts I have in my mind to CSS has been an ongoing challenge for me to master so this project will be another practice opportunity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Right now, I'm using a &lt;DIV&gt; in my markup to host a canvas object generated by Three.js renderer. Once my Angular component has been laid out, I need to get the size of that &lt;DIV&gt; and communicate it to Three.js. A little experimentation with CSS-related properties indicated my &lt;DIV&gt; object's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model/Determining_the_dimensions_of_elements"><code>clientWidth</code> and <code>clientHeight</code></a> were best fit for the job.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using <code>clientWidth</code> was straightforward, but <code>clientHeight </code>started out at zero. This is because during layout, the display engine looked at my &lt;DIV&gt; and saw it had no content. The canvas isn't added until after initial layout in AfterViewInit hook of Angular component lifecycle. I have to create CSS to block out space for this &lt;DIV&gt; during layout despite lack of content at the time. My first effort was to declare a height using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#numbers_lengths_and_percentages">"vh" unit (Viewport Height)</a> to stake my claim on a fraction of the screen, but that is not flexible for general layout. A better answer came later with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">Flexbox</a>. By putting "<code>display: flex;</code>" on my <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> parent, and "<code>flex-grow:1</code>" on the <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> itself, I declared that this Three.js canvas should be given all available remaining space. That accomplished my goal and felt like a more generally applicable solution. A reference I found useful during this adventure was the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox guide from CSS-Tricks.com</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>It's still not perfect, though. It is quite possible Flexbox was not the right tool for the job, but I needed this practice to learn a baseline from which I can compare with another tool such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">CSS Grid</a>. And of course, getting a layout up on screen is literally just the beginning: what happens when the user resizes their window? <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/04/08/angular-component-dynamic-resizing/">Dynamically reacting to resize</a> is its own adventure.</p>
