<p>There are a few missing features I I want in my Micro Sawppy Rover control board, but I'm going to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/03/31/wish-list-for-future-micro-sawppy-control-board/">leave them as to-do list items</a> for a future revision. For now I will continue working with the version I have and solve more pressing problems. The top of the list: free this little rover from the constraints of a wired joystick.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>There are many wireless control ideas on the table. I plan to adapt a version of the WiFi-based control scheme as I used for SGVHAk rover and Sawppy V1, simplified so it runs on an ESP32 instead of a Raspberry Pi. I am also interested in enabling Bluetooth control, with a main focus on BBC micro:bit and a secondary focus on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-controller/" target="_blank">Bluetooth-enabled Xbox controllers</a>. And that's not all! I want to add compatibility with classic radio control equipment, since that was a feature added by multiple Sawppy builders <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mw46d/SGVHAK_Rover" target="_blank">starting with Marco Walther (mw46d)</a>. I have some experience with WiFi and Bluetooth, so RC receiver is the novelty I wanted to try first.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>When I met Marco and his Sawppy rover, I saw he controlled his rover using a large radio transmitter typical of remote control aircraft. In the past I had a few remote control aircraft with similar transmitters, and I also had several pistol-grip style transmitters for remote control cars. When I quit that hobby and gave away most of my equipment, that included old-school FM transmitters on the 72MHz (aircraft) and 75MHz (surface) bands. I kept only the latest hot technology of the time: Spektrum spread spectrum radios on the 2.4GHz band, one ground and one air.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>My Spektrum RC aircraft controller was the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spektrumrc.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdId=SPMR6610" target="_blank">DX6i which I bought as a transmitter-only unit</a> without the usual bundled receiver and servo. At the time I only flew lightweight "<a href="https://www.horizonhobby.com/airplanes/by-completion-level/bind-n-fly/">Bind-N-Fly</a>" aircraft that have their own integrated receiver tailored to the airframe for minimal weight. I thought if I ever needed a receiver I could buy one, which is still true but I didn't want to spend that money unless I need to.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The first venue of investigation is whether someone has tackled teaching an ESP32 to speak Spektrum DSM2 or DSMX protocols directly, eliminating the need for a separate receiver module. They are all on the 2.4GHz band so the radio antenna and associated hardware might be compatible. But if anyone has done so, I failed to find their project. What I did find are multiple projects that used a Spektrum receiver module to handle RF duties and retrieving data over a serial link. Spektrum published <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spektrumrc.com/ProdInfo/Files/Remote%20Receiver%20Interfacing%20Rev%20A.pdf" target="_blank">an official reference document</a> for this type of project, titled <em>Specification for Spektrum Remote Receiver Interfacing: Enabling Use of Spektrum Remotes in Third-Party Products</em>.</p>

<p>This might be an interesting project to tackle, but again I didn't want to spend money right now to buy a compatible Spektrum remote receiver. Fortunately, I have another <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/04/02/micro-sawppy-rover-and-spektrum-dx3e-radio-controller/">Spektrum transmitter, the DX3E, with a corresponding receiver</a>.</p>
