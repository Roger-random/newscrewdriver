<!-- wp:paragraph --><html><body></p>
<p>After I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/18/pc-power-supply-fan-replacement-cwt-gps650s/">installed a working fan in a power supply</a>, I had two broken 120mm 12VDC fans on my hands. One with a bad bearing which needed replacing, and another one which was going to <em>be </em>the replacement until my clumsiness destroyed it. I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/12/10/zalman-120mm-case-fan-clear-with-blue-led-za1225csl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken apart similar fans before</a> so I didn't expect any surprises, but it's always interesting to see how different companies solve similar problems.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The fan with growling bearing is by Yate Loon Electronics. It's very hard to read very much more detail out of the label because its center has been distorted into a faded shiny bubble. I presume this is result of friction heat generated by the failing bearing.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Back of the label is consistent with heat damage. I had expected to see the motor shaft at this point but there's a soft red rubber seal I had to remove first.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's plenty of lubricant visible, too bad none of this was in the right place to do much good.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Popping off the white plastic split ring allowed the fan to come apart. I saw no visible wear to explain the noise this fan had been generating. At some point in the future I hope to have the knowledge to know what to look for, which may require magnification equipment.</p>

<p>A closer view of the core of the fan. It is securely fastened to the plastic base.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I found no fasteners or clips to release, so I went with brute force: using large pliers to rip the core off the base to see the back of the circuit board.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The other fan was functionally fine until I accidentally broke a fan blade. It was made by Poweryear and they have no fault for this. It was entirely my clumsiness.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Under the label was a hard plastic seal. I was surprised to see this, it meant I could not access the plastic split ring (or functional equivalent) to disassemble the fan.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I went straight to ripping the core assembly off the chassis, unintentionally breaking another fan blade in the process. I still couldn't get to the back side of this fan's axle. Teardown foiled!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>No matter, sleeve bearings fail and I'm sure I'll have more dead 120mm cooling fans in the future. For now I can harvest my first 140mm fan from <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/20/thermaltake-smart-bm2-750w-power-supply-sp-750ah3ccb-b/">a misbehaving power supply</a>.</p>
