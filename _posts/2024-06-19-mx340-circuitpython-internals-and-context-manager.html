<p>I've got CircuitPython code to interface with control panel of a Canon MX340 multi-function inkjet, and gradually refining my crude experimental code into an actual reusable CircuitPython library. Using <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/18/mx340-circuitpython-refinements-async-event-but-no-property-setter/">events for synchronization and exposing property setters</a> was just the start.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A major change is to separate communication infrastructure from code that utilizes such infrastructure. For example, I've had code in there blinking the "In Use/Memory" LED to let me know everything is still running. I consider code to transmit the LED control bytes to the NEC K13988 as infrastructure, and the timing loop to toggle LED on and off to be application code. I have a separate asynchronous task that continually updates the LCD content for the same reason, and that should be separated out as well. During the experimental phase I could just mix code in there in a big jumble. A global space where any bit of code can call any other bit of code. But now I have to think about which methods should be part of the API and which are internal implementation.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To reflect this division, a minor change is to rename several methods with a leading underscore. This is a "weak internal" <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#public-and-internal-interfaces">indicator by Python convention</a>. They are understood to be for internal use though there's no language level mechanism preventing callers from accessing them. I guess this means they can be changed without becoming a public API breaking change? Reading the linked section of PEP 8, I saw there's also a way to declare public interface with <code>__all__</code>. As per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package">Python tutorial on module imports</a>, this works in conjunction with "<code>from [module] import *</code>". I don't understand enough about Python modules yet to know if it's applicable to my project.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After I performed this separation, I can clearly see a set of startup and cleanup tasks that have to run before and after application code. This sounds like a job for <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/14/notes-on-pep-343-the-with-statement/">context managers</a>! I can set up all the infrastructure by using an <code>async with</code> statement, and all application code can run within its scope. I first tried to write my context manager with the generator syntax that has a single <code>yield</code> for application code, but that failed: I need to decorate such a generator with <code>@contextmanager</code> to apply supporting infrastructure from <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html">contextlib</a></code>, which has not been ported to CircuitPython. Oops! Fortunately I can still implement a context manager by falling back to <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/#asynchronous-context-managers-and-async-with">using special method names <code>__aenter__()</code> and <code>__aexit__()</code></a>. Once implemented, I can apply even more lessons from my recent study session, implementing a clean separation between my test code from my NEC K13988 infrastructure.</p>

<p>I was pretty pleased with myself with how well this is going when I realized <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/20/mx340-circuitpython-key-events/">I completely forgot about key press events</a>.</p>
