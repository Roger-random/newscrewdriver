<p>I'm pulling apart some retired laptop LCD panels. For the latest panel, I decided to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/07/17/start-with-polarizer-film-transfer/">work on the polarizer film first</a> and I was encouraged by those results. I'll probably try the polarizer first for future panels. But before I move on to the next panel, I want to get a closer look at the LED backlight from this panel I pulled from a retired Dell laptop. The label says it is a LG Display LP133WH2 (TL)(M2) module. A quick internet search says its pixel resolution is 1366x768, which is pretty low by today's standards and not worth the effort to bring back online as a computer display.</p>

<p>Like many previous modules, it had tape all around. Unlike some previous modules, there are several different types of tape involved.</p>

<p>Peeling back the tape, I could see the backlight connector in the center. The previous few panels had them to the side. I'm not sure what design tradeoffs are involved in the different placements.</p>

<p>The chip footprint closest to the backlight connector is unpopulated. This is usually a sign there's another version of the device with enhanced features, but I'm not sure how that works for a display module like this. Whatever it may be, the absent chip is certainly not the backlight LED controller.</p>

<p>The other chip on this side of the circuit board is labeled LG SW0641A. I'm amused that my not-helpful search results included a LG clothes washer with that model number. I'm not sure what this is, but it is definitely not a clothes washer. It is probably the main display controller that talks to the rest of the laptop.</p>

<p>Flipping the panel over, high density data connectors for the LCD array are visible as well as two chips.</p>

<p>Searching for information on a SiW SW5024, I came across vendors willing to sell them but not much else.</p>

<p>But that doesn't matter, because a search for ADD 5201 written on the other chip resulted in a pointer to a "<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADD5201.pdf" target="_blank">High Efficiency, Eight-String White LED Driver for LCD Backlight Applications</a></em>" by Analog Devices.

<p>While the chip can drive up to eight strings, it appears we only have four on this panel. I see a VOUT_LED test point that fans out to four conductors on this connector. And I also see test points corresponding to four strings. FB1 is to the left, below VOUT_LED. FB2, FB3, and FB4 are to the right. If it follows convention of other panels, VOUT_LED would be the current source and FB1 through FB4 are sinks for each of four parallel strings of LEDs.</p>

<p>Probing those points with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/07/04/backlight-led-tester/" target="_blank">a LED tester</a> confirmed the hypothesis, and highlighted another difference on this panel. Previous panels with parallel strings of LEDs would interleave them across the bottom. With an interleaved design a single failed string would still leave most of the display illuminated. But in this panel, each of these four strings are assigned a quarter of the panel area. So if one string failed, one quarter of the display would be darkened and difficult to read. My guess is this method is easier (and cheaper) to wire as a tradeoff for fault tolerance.</p>

<p>With the LED strings verified to illuminate, I set this aside and started working on the final disembodied laptop display panels currently in my possession: a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/01/chunghwa-claa133ua01-polarizer-glue-stronger-than-polarizer-film/">Chunghwa CLAA133UA01 from a Sony VAIO laptop</a>.</p>
