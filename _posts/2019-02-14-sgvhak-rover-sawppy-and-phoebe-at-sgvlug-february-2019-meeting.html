<p>At the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/zvpphlyzdbsb/">February 2019 meet for San Gabriel Valley Linux User's Group (SGVLUG)</a>, Lan and I presented the story of rover building in our hardware hackers spinoff group a.k.a. SGVHAK. This is a practice run for <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/17x/presentations/trouble-rovers">our presentation at Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE) in March</a>. Naturally, the rovers themselves had to be present as visual aids.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-17859 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190214-rovers-at-sgvlug.jpg" alt="20190214 Rovers at SGVLUG" width="1600" height="923"></p>
<p>We started the story in January 2018, when Lan gathered the SGVHAK group to serve as beta testers for <a href="https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/#!/home">Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Open Source Rover</a> project. Then we went through our construction process, which was greatly motivated by our desire to have <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/projects/sgvhak-rover/">SGVHAK rover</a> up and running at least year's SCaLE. Having a rover at SCaLE was not the end, it was only the beginning. I started building my own rover <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/projects/sawppy-the-rover/">Sawppy</a>, and SGVHAK rover continued to pick up hardware upgrades along the way.</p>
<p>On the software side, we have ambition to increase sophistication by adapting the open source <a href="http://www.ros.org/">Robot Operation System (ROS)</a> which led to a small digression to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/projects/phoebe-turtlebot/">Phoebe</a>, my tool for learning ROS. Getting a rover to work effectively under ROS <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/16/ros-in-three-dimensions-navigation-and-planning-will-be-hard/">poses some significant challenges</a> that we have yet to address, but if it was easy it wouldn't be fun!</p>
<p>Since this was a practice talk, the Q&amp;A session at the end was also a forum for feedback on how we could improve the talk for SCaLE. We had some good suggestions on how we might have a better smoother narrative through the story, and we'll see what we can figure out by March.</p>
