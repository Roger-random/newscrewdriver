<img class=" size-full wp-image-7463 alignright" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rosorg-logo1.png" alt="rosorg-logo1" width="254" height="73">One of the ways a TurtleBot makes ROS easier and more approachable for beginners is by simplifying a robot's world into two dimensions. It's somewhat like the introductory chapters of a physics textbook, where all surfaces are friction-less and all collisions are perfectly inelastic. The world of a TurtleBot is perfectly flat and all obstacles have an infinite height. This simplification allows the robot's environment to be represented as a 2D array called an occupancy grid.</p>
<p>Of course, the real world is more complicated. My <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/projects/phoebe-turtlebot/">TurtleBot clone Phoebe</a> encountered several problems just trying to navigate my home. The real world <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/09/22/phoebes-nemesis-floor-transitions/">do not have flat floors</a> and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/09/23/phoebes-nemesis-office-chair/">obstacles come in all shapes, sizes, and heights</a>. Fortunately, researchers have been working on problems encountered by robots venturing outside the simplified world, it's a matter of reading research papers and following their citation links to find the tools.</p>
<p>One area of research improves upon the 2D occupancy grid by building data structures that can represent a robot's environment in 3D. I've found several papers that built upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">octree</a> concept, so that seems to be a good place to start.</p>
<p>But for a robot to build a representation of its environment in 3D, it needs 3D sensors. Phoebe's Neato vacuum LIDAR works in a simplified 2D world but won't cut it anymore in a 3D world. The most affordable entry point here is the Microsoft Kinect sensor bar from an old Xbox 360, which can function as a RGBD (red + blue + green + depth) <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/kinect">input source for ROS</a>.</p>
<p>Phoebe used <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping">Gmapping</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping">SLAM</a>, but that takes 2D laser scan data and generates a 2D occupancy grid. Searching for a 3D SLAM algorithm that can digest RGBD camera data, I searched for "RGBD SLAM" that led immediately to this <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rgbdslam">straightforwardly named package</a>. But of course, that's not the only one around. I've also come across <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros">RTAB-Map</a> which seems to be better maintained and updated for recent ROS releases. And best of all, RTAB-Map has the ability to generate odometry data purely from the RGBD input stream, which might allow me to bypass the challenges of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/13/sawppy-on-ros-open-problems/">calculating Sawppy's chassis odometry from unreliable servo angle readings</a>.</p>
