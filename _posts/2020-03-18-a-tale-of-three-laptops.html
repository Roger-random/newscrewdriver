<p>This is a summary of my research project enabled by the <a href="https://www.nuccinc.org/">National Upcycling Computing Collective (NUCC)</a>. Who allowed me to examine three retired laptop computers of unknown condition, evaluating them as potential robot brain for running <a href="https://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System (ROS)</a>.</p>
<p>For all three machines, I found a way to charge their flat batteries and get them up and running to evaluate their condition. I also took them apart to understand how I might mechanically integrate them into a robot chassis. Each of them got a short first-pass evaluation report, and all three are likely to feature in future projects both robotic and otherwise.</p>
<p>In the order they were examined, the machines were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>HP Split X2</strong> (13-r010dx): This was a tablet/laptop convertible designed for running Windows 8, an operating system that was also designed for such a dual-use life. Out of the three machines, this one had the longest feature list including the most modern and powerful Intel Core i3 CPU. But as a tradeoff, it was also the bulkiest of the bunch. Thus while the machine will have no problem running ROS, the mechanical integration will be a challenge. Its <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/26/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-first-pass-evaluation/">first pass evaluation report is here</a>. For full details query <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/tag/13-r010dx/">tag of <code>13-r010dx</code></a> for all posts relating to this machine, including future projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Toshiba Chromebook 2</strong> (CB35-B3340): This machine was roughly the same age as the HP, but as a Chromebook it had a far less ambitious feature list but that also gave it a correspondingly lighter and slimmer profile. It is possible to run a form of Ubuntu (and therefore ROS) inside a Chromebook, but there are various limitations of doing so. Its suitability as a robot brain is still unknown. In the meantime, the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/05/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-first-pass-evaluation/">first pass evaluation report is here</a>, and all related posts (past and future) tagged with <code><a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/tag/cb35-b3340/">CB35-B3340</a></code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>HP Mini</strong> (110-1134CL): This was a ~10 year old netbook, making it the oldest and least capable machine of the bunch. A netbook was a simple modest machine when new, and the age meant this hardware lacks enough processing power to handle modern software. While technically capable of running ROS Kinetic, the low power processor could only run the simplest of robots and unable to take advantage of the more powerful aspects of ROS.

</ol>
<p>While not the focus of my research project, looking over four old laptops in rapid succession (these three from NUCC plus the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/19/dell-latitude-e6230-working-too-well-to-be-dismembered-nucc-to-the-rescue/">refurbished Dell Latitude E6230 I bought</a>) also gave me a perspective on <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/19/preparing-retired-laptops-for-computing-beginners/">preparing old laptops for computing beginners</a>.</body></html></p>
