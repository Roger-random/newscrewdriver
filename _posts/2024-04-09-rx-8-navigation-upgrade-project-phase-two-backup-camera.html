<p>My 2004 Mazda RX-8 has a cracked radiator. While I wait for a replacement radiator to be shipped to me, I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/08/temporary-radiator-fix-using-jb-weld/">applied some J-B Weld as a short term workaround</a>. And since I already have tools scattered about my garage, I thought I would work on a few more RX-8 project to-do items. First on the list is I will <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/15/rx-8-navigation-upgrade-project-phase-one-complete/">resume my navigation screen upgrade project</a>. I had removed the stock GPS navigation system LCD screen and replaced it with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/02/carplay-and-android-auto-receiver-for-2004-mazda-rx-8/">a standalone receiver for wireless Android Auto/CarPlay</a>. My receiver came bundled with a backup camera, but I decided against tearing up too much of the car before I decided if I even like the receiver. So I paused after receiver installation to evaluate.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>It's been a few months and the inexpensive receiver has not been perfect. I have to manually adjust screen brightness between daylight and night time driving, but that's only 3 taps and a mild annoyance I can live with. I've had the occasional audio stutter and data dropout, reminding me why wired connections are always more reliable than wireless. Sadly wired Android Auto/CarPlay have fallen out of favor with standalone receivers like these. I've also seen the thing crash and reboot itself, but not often enough for me to recognize any pattern to what might have trigger it.</p>

<p>Despite its imperfections, I have grown fond of having my phone automatically connect to my car every time I start it up. It's nice to always have Google Maps on screen and access to my entire audio entertainment library stored on my phone. Given its low price (<a href="https://amzn.to/44PY8Pw">$60 as of this writing</a> *) I can forgive a few hiccups here and there. It's a keeper! I will now proceed to install that backup camera which had merely been gathering dust the past few months.</p>

<p>Accessing the stock factory navigation display hood is a lot easier the second time around. I now know enough to avoid completely disassembling the center console like <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/06/removing-navigation-lcd-assembly-from-2004-mazda-rx-8/">I did the first time</a>. For example, now that I know I only need to access two fasteners behind the factory audio head unit's face plate, I only need to slide it out a few centimeters leaving all wire bundles connected. Much easier this way!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After plugging the camera cable into the receiver, I ran its wire down the left side of the center console. Under the ashtray and along the center of the car underneath all cupholders. I mostly followed the existing navigation computer wiring harness. Speaking of which, I took this opportunity to unplug all connectors from that outdated computer so it doesn't consume power uselessly. I thought about removing it entirely but I didn't want to leave a hole in the console between rear seats. The backup camera cable proceeded under the now-unplugged computer, behind the right rear passenger seat back, and into the trunk where it can meet up with the camera module. That takes care of the electrical wiring, now I need <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/10/rx-8-backup-camera-bracket/">a camera mounting bracket</a>.</p>
