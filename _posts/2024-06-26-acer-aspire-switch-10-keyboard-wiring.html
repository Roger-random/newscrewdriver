<p>I want to experiment with turning a salvaged laptop keyboard module into a USB HID keyboard. My test subject is <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/25/dusting-off-acer-aspire-switch-10-keyboard/">this keyboard pulled from an Acer Aspire Switch 10</a>. I have successfully unsoldered its connector in the hopes I can solder it onto a breakout board I had ordered. While I wait for the board to be shipped to me, I can do a little scouting.</p>

<p>The easiest observation was that 2 out of 26 pins appear to be unused. They are present at the flex cable connector but immediately disappear into nothingness.</p>

<p>The remaining 24 wires are seen going into the keyboard module underneath a piece of black fabric tape. Peeling that tape off may gain more insight, but I'm not going to. Flex cables can only flex a finite number of times before something breaks, so I'm trying to keep handling and manipulation to a minimum.</p>

<p>Examining the circuit board, I looked for traces that are significantly wider than others or maybe wires that span multiple pins in parallel. Both are typical indications of power or ground wires, but I didn't see anything of the sort. I then looked for components like decoupling capacitors or current-limiting resistors, and didn't notice any good candidates either. This is consistent with my memory this keyboard was not backlit.</p>

<p>Looking on the back side, I see very few wires and they are mostly consistent with wires jumping over other perpendicular wires on the front. Not all of the vias lined up with traces I could see, which would be consistent with a circuit board with more than two layers. Though there are traces I couldn't see, I think it is possible all 24 wires are connected directly to the chip adjacent to the now-unsoldered connector.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I read the chip marking as IT8595E-128 and the logo matches that of Taiwan-based ITE Tech, Inc. But there's <a href="https://www.ite.com.tw/en/product/category?cid=1">no IT8595E-128 listed on their product website</a> today. The closest I found is an IT8596 under "Notebook product line", advertised to be a laptop peripheral controller. Sounds about right, but there's no datasheet download for me to see if it might be a sibling of this IT8595. Perhaps IT8595 is a discontinued product, or perhaps it was a custom design exclusive to Acer. Either way, I'm not going to get any more information here. To get any more information on how this keyboard module is wired, I will need to wait for <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/27/proto-advantage-fpc-connector-dip-adapter-fpc080p030/">my adapter board to arrive</a>.</p>
