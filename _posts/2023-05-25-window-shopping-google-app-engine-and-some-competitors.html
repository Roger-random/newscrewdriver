<p>I think I have a working understanding of Angular Standalone components and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/24/angular-standalone-components-for-future-projects/">plan to use them for my future Angular projects</a>. But the sample application in "<em>Getting Started with Angular Standalone Components</em>" code lab had other details worth looking into. Two Google cloud services were included in the exercise: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/">Diagflow</a> Messenger and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine">App Engine</a>. I assume their inclusion were a bit of Google product cross-promotion, as neither were strictly required to build Angular applications using standalone components.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Diagflow Messenger makes it easy to incorporate a chatbot onto your page. I personally always ignore chatbots as much as I can, so I'm not likely to incorporate one to my own project. On the other hand, Google App Engine looks interesting.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The standalone component code lab project only used App Engine to host static files via <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#express.static"><code>express.static</code></a>. In that respect, it could have just as easily been hosted via GitHub Pages, which is what I've been using because my projects so far have been strictly static affairs. But I have ambition for more dynamic projects in the future and for those ideas I'll need a server. When I took the Ruby on Rails Tutorial (<a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2016/12/02/rails-tutorial-take-2/">twice</a>) aspiring web developers could host their projects on Heroku's free tier. Unfortunately, Heroku has since <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/11/19/heroku-free-rides-are-over/">eliminated their free tier</a>. Web development learners like me will have to look elsewhere for a free option.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Heroku implemented their service on top of Amazon Web Services. Looking around AWS documentation, I didn't find an equivalent service making it trivial to deploy backend projects like Ruby on Rails or Node.js. We could certainly roll our own on top AWS EC2 instances and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-nodejs-web-app/">there's a tutorial to do so</a> but it's not free. While there's an EC2 introductory offer for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">750 free hours in the first 12 months</a>, after that there's nothing in Amazon's always-free tier for this kind of usage.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google App Engine is similar to Heroku in offering developer-friendly way to deploy backend projects, in this case <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/runtime#node.js-18">Node.js</a>. And even better, basic level services are free if I <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/quotas">stay within relevant quotas</a>. According to documentation, this service is built on containers rather than EC2 virtual machines like Heroku. I don't know if there's enough of a difference in developer experience for me to worry about. One footnote I noticed was the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/reference/system-packages">list of system packages</a> available to my projects. I saw a few names that might be useful like FFmpeg, ImageMagick, and SQLite. (Aside: The documentation page also claims Chrome headless, but I don't actually see it on the list.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To round out the big three, I poked around Microsoft's Azure documentation. I found Azure App Service and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-nodejs">instructions for deploying a Node.js web app</a>. Azure also <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/linux/#pricing">offers a free tier</a> and it sounds like the free tier is also subject to quotas. Unlike Google App Engine, everything on Azure comes to a halt if I hit free tier quotas. For experiments, I prefer Azure's approach of halting. Exceeding free tier limits on Google App Engine starts charging money rather than taking my app offline. If I build something I want to actually use, I might prefer Google's method. Sure, I might have to pay a few bucks, but at least I can still access my app.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>These two free plans should be good enough for me to learn and evolve my skills, assuming they don't disapper as Heroku free tier did. If I get far enough in my web application development adventures to be willing to pay for server capacity, I'm will also look into an independent offering like <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/computing/">DreamHost's DreamCompute</a> or one of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/solutions/nodejs-hosting">DigitalOcean's products for Node.js hosting</a>.</p>

<p>But that's for later. Right now, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/26/notes-on-angular-forms-guide/">I have more I could learn</a> from Angular standalone components code lab sample application.</p>
