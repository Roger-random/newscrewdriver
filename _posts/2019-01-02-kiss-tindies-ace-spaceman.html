<p>Continuing the project to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/31/kiss-tindies-a-wire-form-practice-project/">give KISS Tindies copper wire bodies</a>, I moved on to the next PCB puppy head. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)#Make-up_designs">Wikipedia tells me this one is the Spaceman</a>. Just like I did with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/01/kiss-tindies-paul-starchild/">Starchild</a>, I started with the guitar and built outwards from there. Bending wire is still slow going. I'm sure skilled artists and sculptors could have done it in a fraction of the time, but I won't get better unless I practice!</p>
<p>I'm also trying out different techniques as I go. I struggled to hold Starchild parts together as I soldered, so for Spaceman I tried out a technique I saw in the Hackaday Supercon <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/03/competitive-soldering-gets-heated-at-hackaday-superconference/">SMD soldering challenge</a>: use tape to hold things in place. The picture showed high temperature Kapton tape, I just used plain desktopÂ <a href="https://www.scotchbrand.com/3M/en_US/scotch-brand/products/all-tape/">Scotch tape</a>. This meant another learning opportunity: I've learned copper wire conducts soldering heat very well. It doesn't take much to degrade the adhesive on Scotch tape, leaving residue on my copper wires. Thankfully the plastic substrate could stand quite a bit before it would melt as well, so the shape holds up through soldering.</p>

<p>Another novelty of Spaceman was the open loop forming his right hand. (Front-right paw?) I'm a little worried it would hook on things in the future, but I have to admit that it seems to work well visually.</p>
