<p>Based on <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/21/micro-sawppy-beta-2-wire-channels-hinder-motor-conversion/">my experience modifying wheel drive motors</a> on my little rover Micro Sawppy Beta 2 (MSB2), I decided it was trending towards a rover design that would be too difficult to work on. If I, as the designer of MSB2, am tearing my hair out struggling with wire routing, how can I realistically expect beginners to work with this thing? I think MSB2 succeeded at being really cute, unfortunately the beauty was only skin deep and its core difficulties are not what I want.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>But while I stopped further work on MSB2, I wanted to continue the task I was in the middle of: trying out the idea of using DC gearmotors. The micro-servos I used in MSB2 taught me that my original idea for driving little rover wheels were unreliable. While we could <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/04/converting-mg90s-metal-gear-micro-servo-to-continuous-rotation/" target="_blank">modify micro servos for continuous rotation</a>, there's no guarantee their control circuits would give us usable speed control. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/20/micro-sawppy-beta-2-poor-proportional-response/" target="_blank">Sometimes they don't</a>! In order to guarantee a little Sawppy rover could be reliably built, I must take motor speed control into my own hands.</p>

<p>This decision started when I removed all electronics from MSB2 wheel servos, using them as just a motor with a gearbox inside a micro-servo sized enclosure. (FYI <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2941" target="_blank">Adafruit product #2941 is exactly like this</a>, no modification required.) Even though I'm throwing out half the device, it's still a very inexpensive way to obtain a small DC gearmotor thanks to the large volume market of generic commodity micro servos. But if we are going to use a small high volume commodity DC gearmotor to drive little rover wheels, there's actually a better option: TT gear motors.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These DC motor + gearbox units are ubiquitous like generic micro servos, mass produced by many manufacturers at high volume and low cost. It is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3777" target="_blank">available as Adafruit #3777</a> but they are <a href="https://amzn.to/38cEhPQ">definitely not the only retailers</a>. (*) I first learned they existed when I saw them pop up in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackaday.com/2018/04/01/yellow-robot-wheels-rolling-out/" target="_blank">multiple projects submitted to a Hackaday contest</a>, and a little background research unveiled how widespread they were.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since I've decided to add the complexity of DC motor driver modules, these TT motors immediately jump to the top of the list. Unlike micro servos, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/23/notes-on-tt-gear-motor/">TT gear motors were <em>designed </em>for driving wheels</a>.</p>
