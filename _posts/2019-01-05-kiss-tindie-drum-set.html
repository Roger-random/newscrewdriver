<p>The <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/31/kiss-tindies-a-wire-form-practice-project/">four KISS Tindie PCB heads</a> now have copper wire bodies, but only three of them have their instruments. They can't go on tour like this - the drummer needs a drum set!</p>
<p>Kidding aside, a copper wire frame drum set would be a good first step into creating three-dimensional shapes using copper wire. I had thought about creating the band members' bodies in three dimensions, but such complex shapes were above my current skill level -- making it in two dimensions was challenging enough.</p>
<p>But perhaps the simpler cylindrical geometry of a drum set would be within my reach. Or at least, a simple caricature of a drum set, since everything I knowÂ came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit">15 minutes of reading Wikipedia</a>. The biggest drum that dominates visually is called the bass drum, so I started crafting cylinders to get a feel of size. I settled on this size which was shaped using a 3D-printed 30mm diameter cylinder.</p>

<p>Once I picked a size for the bass drum size, I started trying every round thing on my workbench to see how well their diameter might work for the other drums. The outside diameter of a 608 bearing seemed a little too large, but the diameter of a sub-C nicad battery cell is just about right.</p>

<p>Some wire bending and soldering later, we have a vague approximation of a drum kit as built by someone with no knowledge of drums. But it gets the point across - our KISS Tindie drummer <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/04/kiss-tindies-peter-catman-completes-the-band/">the Catman</a> now has a drum set.</p>
