<img class=" size-medium wp-image-5552 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/catleap2.png?w=222" alt="Catleap2" width="222" height="300">The second iteration of the luggable frame experiment addressed the failings of the first version by relying less on acrylic and more on aluminum. The first iteration was a good experiment to see if acrylic was strong enough for the work. Once V1 conclusively proved the weaknesses, it's time to fall back to the known quantity.</p>
<p>The following changes were made for version 2:</p>
<p><em>Extrusion upgrade</em>: In the interest of greater rigidity, the extrusions themselves were upgraded from Misumi HFS3 (15mm x 15mm cross section) to HFS5 (20mm x 20mm). The smaller extrusions seemed to be doing the job but they did exhibit some flex. And we had HFS5 conveniently on hand so let's use it!</p>
<p><em>Connection upgrade</em>: In V1 the extrusion T-joint at the base of the frame was held together by the side pieces of acrylic. Though it seemed to work, V2 went with a stronger solution by using metal connectors for the joint. (Misumi HBLFSNF5).</p>
<p><em>Handle upgrade</em>: The V1 handles were part of the acrylic assembly. With the reduction in acrylic usage, there wasn't enough left to carry the load of the whole frame. So the handle became another aluminum extrusion.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5548" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/catleap2-rear.jpg?w=300" alt="Catleap2-Rear" width="300" height="225">PC tray upgrade</em>: This was the first acrylic thing that failed in V1. The PC is now held in place by aluminum structure instead of an acrylic cutout which makes it quite secure. Three of the extrusion right-angle connectors were re-purposed as "claws" to keep the PC case in place.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5549" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/catleap2-side.jpg?w=225" alt="Catleap2-Side" width="225" height="300">VESA mount upgrade</em>: The worrisome flex in the Catleap monitor enclosure was traced down to the metal threads inside the Catleap enclosure that were longer than the thickness of the enclosure plastic. This meant when the mounting screws fully engaged, there was still a bit of space between the VESA mount plate and the monitor's rear surface, allowing movement. A spacer plate was added to fill that gap. Now the VESA mounting plate on the frame is fully pressed against the monitor's rear surface, greatly reducing the flex.</p>
<p>All this additional structure added up to a very secure frame for carrying around the Yamakasi Catleap monitor with the HP Z220 computer. Unfortunately it also added weight which was a concern even before the frame came into the picture. The heft means this is probably the end of the line for the Catleap + Z220 experiments. Frame V2 will serve as a perfectly good workstation albeit not a very portable one.</p>
<p>The idea of building a Luggable PC around a commercially available monitor will continue, with the focus shifting to using smaller and lighter components.</body></html></p>
