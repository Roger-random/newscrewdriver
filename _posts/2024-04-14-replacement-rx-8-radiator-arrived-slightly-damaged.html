<p>I ordered a replacement radiator and associated hoses for my 2004 Mazda RX-8 before <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/13/problems-of-a-mazda-rx-8-with-low-compression/">I found out my engine is terminally ill</a>. I briefly contemplated not bothering with the radiator but then I decided to look on the bright side: If the engine is on its way out anyway, it doesn't matter as much if I screw things up. I can dive into the learning experience of performing my own radiator replacement with less pressure. So far I've done oil changes, brake pad replacements, ignition system upgrade from <a href="https://black-halo-racing.myshopify.com/products/ignition-upgrade">Black Halo Racing</a>, and replaced a water pump that had started weeping coolant. A radiator replacement seems like an appropriate next step up in difficulty.</p>

<p>After the radiator arrived I opened the shipping box and was mildly disappointed to see radiator fin damage both front and back. The radiator had fallen off of its packing foam blocks and the air pillows fell out of place. I wished they had taped the foam and pillow to the radiator instead of loosely draping. Inspecting the radiator, I saw no other signs of damage. All mounting points seem intact and accounted for, and all three hose fittings appear to be in good shape. The smallest and most fragile fitting for coolant reservoir connection even got a separate protective rubber boot!</p>

<p>Besides, the fin damage is pretty trivial compared to visible condition on my remaining heat exchange units: the air conditioning condenser in the middle and oil coolers on either side. Their fins are pretty bent up from twenty years of road debris, and they're still sufficient. Besides, as a clumsy beginner, I think it's pretty likely I'd bend a few radiator fins as I try to install it. If this radiator is not going to stay pristine for long anyway, why worry about a few bent fins now? It will have enough cooling capacity to keep the engine from overheating. And if I'm wrong... well, the engine was on its way out anyway. I'm going to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/15/old-rx-8-radiator-was-about-to-fail-anyway/">jump in with an enthusiasm for learning</a>.</p>
