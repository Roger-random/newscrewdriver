<p>My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_5X">Nexus 5X</a> phone took a 30-minute swim in a pool due to my negligence. It was unsurprisingly dark when retrieved from the pool. I've already ordered a replacement phone but I was curious: could it be brought back to life?</p>
<p>The first order of business was water removal. A public swimming pool has all sorts of chemicals unfriendly to electronics. The first thing I found upon return to home was a jug of distilled water originally intended for the car's battery. Good enough for a starting point, I left the phone soaking in distilled water while I went online to read up on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Nexus_5X">Nexus 5X disassembly on iFixit</a>.</p>
<p>The information is promising - by modern phone standards, this model is very easy to disassemble and repair. Following the instructions, I disassembled the phone into its major components, performed a second round of rinsing, and laid the parts out to dry.</p>

<p>After drying overnight, it was obvious soaking in distilled water was not enough. There were enough chemicals remaining to leave a white residue on many surfaces and corrosion began eating many components. Here's a close-up picture of the SIM slot and a few of the surrounding components. The brown stuff building up in the lower-right is especially worrisome.</p>

<p>If gentle soak in distilled water wasn't enough, it's time to step things up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol">Isopropyl alcohol</a> is easily available as a first aid disinfectant though at a lower concentration than ideal. First aid rubbing alcohol is 70% alcohol and electronics cleaning usually specifies alcohol content of 90% or higher. Since time is of the essence, the first aid stuff will have to do. Once the parts are soaking, I also ran a small plastic bristle brush over the surfaces to dislodge any remaining pool chemical and the corrosion that is accessible.</p>
<p>It's not clear if the alcohol or the brushing was more useful, or if they were both required, but things look much better after the alcohol dried off overnight.</p>

<p>Some printed numbers were erased by the alcohol, which I wasn't worried about. Some adhesives were dissolved by the alcohol, and I'm worried about the tape that used to sit over the CPU. I will need a replacement heat conductor to help transfer heat generated by the CPU to the chassis frame for dissipation.</p>
