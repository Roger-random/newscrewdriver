<p>My first <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a> project was sent to <a href="https://www.oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a> almost two weeks ago, and my digital design is now back in my hands in physical form. It is really quite exciting to hold in my hands a circuit board I designed. Three copies of it, in fact, as per usual OSH Park practice.</p>
<p>The first order of business is to check for simple mistakes. I pulled out my multimeter to verify that I have good connection between all the VCC pins to the VCC plane, and similarly all the ground pins are connected to the ground plane. Then I brought up my design in KiCad and checked continuity for the pins I designated. I don't know if I exhaustively checked them all, but a large portion were verified.</p>
<p>Once I'm satisfied my design has been faithfully produced by KiCad, it was time to pull out the soldering iron. I thought I'd do some incremental tests - solder a subset of components to verify the subset of LEDs light up correctly - but I was eager to see it all light up so I went ahead and populated the whole board. The legs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N2222">2N2222A</a> transistors in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TO-92">TO-92</a> package were closer together than I'm used to in my soldering projects, but other than that challenge it was all simple and straightforward soldering.</p>

<p>And finally, the moment of truth. I was working in Tux-Lab and a bunch of nearby guys gathered around to see me power up the board for the first time.</p>
<p>&lt;drum roll&gt;</p>
<p>It's alive! The test pattern already programmed into the PIC started cycling through the LED display. This success is a great confidence-builder. I had fully expected to find problems with the board that I would have to fix in KiCad and send back to OSH Park for another set of circuit boards to be produced. The only problem I encountered was the PICkit 3 does not fit nicely alongside the power connector. I could make it work by making them wedge together at an angle. Neither were happy with it but it should be relatively rare to have the programmer attached.</p>
<p>Well, I guess break time from PIC software is over - I no longer have an excuse to play with other projects. The task of writing my I²C driver routine for this display is back on the to-do list.</p>
