<p>I got my ESP32 <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/04/14/notes-on-getting-esp32-on-wifi/">on my local home WiFi network</a>, but it doesn't respond to anything yet. The next step is to write code so it could act as a static web server, sending files stored in ESP32 flash memory to clients requesting them via HTTP GET. The good news is that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_server.html" target="_blank">setting up a HTTP server</a> was really easy, and I quickly got it up and running to serve a "Hello World" string hard-coded in my ESP32 source code.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I briefly considered calling this situation good enough and move on. I could embed my HTML/CSS/JavaScript files as hard-coded strings inside my C files. But doing so meant reviewing those files to make sure they don't have conflicts with C string syntax, and that's something I'd have to do every time I wanted to update any of those files. This is quite clumsy. What I really want is to keep those files to be served over HTTP separate from my C code, so that they could be updated independently of code and I don't have to review them for C string incompatibility.</p>

<p>Doing this requires carving out a portion of an ESP32's flash memory storage for a simple file storage system called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/spiffs.html" target="_blank">SPIFFS</a>. Allocation of flash storage is declared in a partition file, which is a list of comma-separated values (CSV) of partition information like size, offset, and assigned purpose. PlatformIO ESP-IDF project template includes a default partition file but it had no provision for a SPIFFS partition. I need to add one to my project to override that default. I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/storage/spiffs/partitions_example.csv" target="_blank">an example partition file</a> as my starting point, copying it into my project and making only minor changes. (I didn't need quite as large of a SPIFFS partition.) If I were using ESP-IDF directly, I believe I would use the <code>menuconfig</code> tool to point to my partition file. But as I'm <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/02/24/using-platformio-for-esp-idf-development/" target="_blank">using ESP-IDF indirectly via PlatformIO</a>, I specified my partition file location <a href="https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#partition-tables">using a parameter in the <code>platformio.ini</code> configuration file</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Once I have a partition, I need to put my files in it. Apparently it's not as simple as using a USB flash drive, I have to build the entire data partition (like building a disk image for a PC) and upload the whole thing. There are ESP-IDF command line tools to build SPIFFS partition, I decided to go with PlatformIO route by specifying <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_platformio.html#data-dir" target="_blank">the <code>platformio.ini</code> parameter <code>data-dir</code></a>. I could point it at my Node.js working directory, which is great because that meant I only had one copy of these files in my code repository. Eliminating the task of keeping multiple copies in sync. From the PlatformIO UI I could then use "Platform/Build Filesystem Image" followed by "Platform/Upload Filesystem Image". I haven't figured out if this is necessarily separate from code update or if there's a way to do both at the same time.</p>

<p>Putting files in SPIFFS isn't useful until I have code to read those files. I followed the links to Espressif <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/1cb31e5/examples/storage/spiffs" target="_blank">code example for reading and writing to SPIFFS</a>. And ugh... I haven't had to deal with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/storage/spiffs/main/spiffs_example_main.c" target="_blank">old school C file input/output API</a> in quite some time. I briefly considered the effort to keep things memory efficient by breaking these file I/O actions up into small pieces, but I don't need that kind of sophistication just yet. In order to simplify code, and because I have RAM to spare at the moment, I allocated a large buffer so all the operations to read from SPIFFS and send via HTTP can be done in a single pass. Which worked well for sending data to the control client, but now I need to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/04/16/shiny-new-esp32-websocket-support/">listen to control commands coming back</a>.</p>
