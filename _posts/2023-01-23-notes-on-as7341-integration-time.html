<p>After pleasantly surprised at the fact my web app project is <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/22/impressively-long-tail-of-android-chrome-updates/">unlikely to leave my old Android phones behind</a>, I got back to my "learn by doing" process. As originally planned, I'm going to leave my first draft "Basic" UI as-is for fallback/debug purposes. I made a copy to serve as the starting point of my "Standard" UI and initial focus is on sensor integration time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Full Width Control</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First change was minor and cosmetic: "Basic" didn't use any CSS styles, and "Standard" started with just one style to make input sliders 100% of available width. The default width was annoyingly narrow. Making it full width helps me make finer adjustments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ASTEP Value Fixed at ~10ms</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>AS7341 sensor integration time is controlled by two parameters: ATIME and ASTEP. As per datasheet, the resulting integration time follows the formula: (ATIME+1)*(ASTEP+1)*2.78 microseconds. My "Basic" UI exposed both parameters directly, but I want to use something more human-friendly for the "Standard" UI. I decided to keep ASTEP fixed at 3596. Per the formula (3596+1)2.78 microseconds = 9999.66 microseconds, or just a tiny bit less than 10 milliseconds. Keeping ASTEP fixed at 3596 means the ATIME range of 0-255 can dictate integration time anywhere from 10ms to 2560ms a.k.a. 2.56 seconds. This covers the entire time range I want for initial experiments. I may adjust this range in the future after playing with the sensor some more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Read Time is Double Integration Time</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once I had set up the UI to adjust integration in 10ms increments, I took a few readings at various settings and noticed the actual time spent in <code>readAllChannels()</code> is a lot longer than integration time. If I configure for 1 second (1000ms), I end up waiting two seconds. I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Roger-random/as7341_webui/commit/1ff1a3af2d0f501260e7c51f72db5e05cdc00041" target="_blank">added a bit of tracking code to my ESP32 Arduino sketch</a> and verified it wasn't just my imagination: actual read time is over double integration time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This was puzzling until I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/08/unrolling-adafruit-as7341-readallchannels/" target="_blank">remembered <code>readAllChannels()</code> implementation</a>: it configures AS7341 sensor multiplexor (SMUX) to read sensors F1-F4 plus clear and NIR, performs a read, then configures SMUX for sensors F5-F8 (keeping clear and NIR) and perform a second read. So, a one-second sensor integration time meant one second spent for F1-F4 and another second spent on F4-F8. Add in a few tens of milliseconds for processing and communication overhead, and we've explained the observation of a little bit over twice integration time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is something to keep in mind depending on sensor application. For example, if I want my browser UI to update once a second, I need to set integration time to be less than half a second.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UX Design Decision</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Which led to the next question: Should my browser UI show the integration time, because that's how I'm configuring the sensor? Or should it show double that time, because that is a better estimate of time I should expect to wait for a reading? <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Roger-random/as7341_webui/commit/6bcf18a78f04746230fd4a9231b8c6b3b4400f53" target="_blank">I decided to go with double</a> for my "Standard" UI: this is a user experience issue, so I should be faithful to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/24/as7341-adc-fullscale-and-led-illumination-control/">what the user will experience</a>.</p>
