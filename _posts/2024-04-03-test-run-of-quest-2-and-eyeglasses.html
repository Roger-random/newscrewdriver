<p>OK so sticking some googly eyes on my Quest 2 wasn't a serious solution to any problem, but there was another aspect of Apple Vision Pro I found interesting: they didn't make any allowances for eyeglasses. Users need to have perfect vision, or wear contacts, or order lens inserts that clip onto their headset. This particular design decision allows a much slimmer headset and a very Apple thing to do.</p>

<p>Quest 3 headset <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-3-zenni-vr-prescription-lenses/">has similar provisions for clip-on lenses</a>, but my Quest 2 did not. And even though Quest 2 technically allowed for eyeglasses, it is a tiny bit too narrow for my head and would pinch my glasses' metal arms against my head. I thought having corrective lenses inside the headset would eliminate that side pressure and was worth investigating.</p>

<p>Since Zenni isn't standing by to make clip-on lenses for my Quest 2, I thought I would try to get creative and reuse one of my retired eyeglasses. I have several that were retired due to damaged arms and they would be perfect for this experiment. I selected a set, pulled out my small screwdriver set, and unfastened the arms leaving just the front frame.</p>

<p>For this first test, my aim is for quick-and-dirty. I used tape to hold the sides in place. For this first test I didn't bother trying to find an ideal location.</p>

<p>The center was held with two rolled-up wads of double-sided foam tape. I believe the ideal spacing is something greater than zero, but this was easy for a quick test.</p>

<p>Clipping the face interface back on held my side strips of tape in place. I put this on my face and... it's marginally usable! My eyesight is bad enough that I would just see a blur without my eyeglasses. With this taped-on solution, made without any consideration for properly aligned position, I could make out majority of features. I still couldn't read small text, but I could definitely see well enough to navigate virtual environments. I declare this first proof-of-concept test a success, I will need to follow it up with a more precise positioning system to see if I can indeed make my own corrective lenses accessory for my Quest 2.</p>
