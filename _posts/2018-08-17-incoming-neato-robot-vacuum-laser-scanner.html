<p>The biggest argument against buying a Monoprice robot vacuum for ROS hacking is that I already know how to build a two-wheeled robot chassis. In fact two-wheeled differential drive is a great simple test configuration that I've done <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/04/06/test-chassis-with-two-wheel-differential-drive/">once</a> or <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/05/19/oldie-but-goodie-two-wheel-differential-drive-test-for-sawppy-the-rovers-wheels/">twice</a>. Granted, I have yet to build either of them into having full odometry capability, but I do not expect that to be a fundamentally difficult thing.</p>
<p>No, the bigger challenge is integrating sensing into a robot. Everything I've built so far has no smarts - they're basically just big remote-control cars. The ambition is to ramp up on <em>intelligent</em> robots and that means giving a robot some sense of the world. The TurtleBot 3 Burger reads its surroundings with a <a href="http://www.robotis.us/360-laser-distance-sensor-lds-01-lidar/">laser distance sensor that costs $180</a>. It's been a debate whether I should buy one or not.</p>
<p>But at this past Monday's SGVHAK meetup, I was alerted to the fact that some home robot vacuums use a laser scanner to map their surroundings for use planning more efficient vacuum patterns. I knew home robot vacuums have evolved beyond the random walk vacuum pattern of the original Roomba, but I didn't know their sophistication has evolved to incorporate laser scanners. Certainly neither of the robot vacuums on clearance at Monoprice have a laser scanner.</p>
<p>But there are robot vacuums with laser scanners and, more importantly, some of these scanner-equipped robot vacuums are getting old enough to break down and stop working, resulting in scavenged components being listed on eBay... including their laser scanner! Items come and go, but I found <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/283094400379">this scavenged scanner for $54</a> and clicked "Buy It Now". The listing claims it works, but it's eBay... we'll find out for sure when it arrives. But even if it doesn't, Neato vacuums are <a href="https://losangeles.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=Neato">available nearby for roughly the same price</a>, so I have the opportunity for multiple attempts.</p>
<p>The unit off eBay was purportedly from a <a href="https://www.neatorobotics.com/robot-vacuum/xv/xv-11/">Neato XV-11</a> vacuum and someone in the ROS community has already <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/xv_11_laser_driver">written a package</a> to interface with the sensor. The tutorials section of this package describes how to <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Connecting%20the%20XV-11%20Laser%20to%20USB">wire it up electrically</a>. It looks fairly straightforward and I hope it'll all come together as simply as I hope it will when the eBay item arrives in about a week and a half.</p>
