<p>Once I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/02/26/mx340-horizontal-print-carriage-actuator-removal/">removed the horizontal X-axis (print carriage) actuator assembly</a> from my Canon MX340 multi-function inkjet, I could see several mechanisms that were previously hidden. My attention first went to the lever that was <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/02/21/mx340-print-carriage-motor-and-actuation/">pushed by the print carriage at a specific position</a>. Now I can push on it with my thumb and turn the friction-coated paper feed shaft manually to see things move. Conclusion: this lever starts the process for feeding a sheet of paper from the stack in the paper tray into the print engine.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The other end of the lever sits within this T-shaped slot inside the gearbox. Normally it sits in this center position, which I will call "Neutral" because no rotational power is transmitted to the paper tray mechanism.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once pressed, the T-slot can shift to one of two positions depending on which direction the paper feed motor is turning. I will call this position "Reverse" because the paper feed motor is moving opposite of the direction when printing.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this mode, power is transmitted to the big rubber-coated roller in the paper tray, rotating it in the direction to feed paper. This is quite bizarre to me because, as already stated, this happens when the adjacent friction-coated paper feed shaft is rotating backwards, a recipe for a paper jam! I thought maybe the roller motion was just a side effect, but later gearbox teardown would confirm this is deliberate: a gear is specifically engaged in "Reverse" for this purpose, and it doesn't move anything else. Whatever purpose this counter-intuitive motion serves, it is an intentional part of the system.</p>

<p>Shifting into "Forward" gear, I see a sequence of events consistent with feeding a sheet of paper from the paper tray.</p>

<p>Here is a closeup of the paper handling mechanism at the base of the paper tray.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>This is the bottom of the paper tray. A spring-loaded and cam-operated mechanism pushes it forward and upwards so the top sheet of paper in the paper tray makes contact with the rest of the mechanism.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>I think this pair of claws usually keeps the stack of paper separated from the feed rollers. During this paper feed sequence, the claws retract.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>This mechanism has a smaller roller that receives no power, but its position can change to mesh with the big powered roller, or retracted so there's a gap.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The big roller also receives rotational power in "Forward" via a different gear path, so now it turns in sync with the friction-coated paper feed shaft and there would be no paper jam.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A mechanical gear-and-cam system choreographs the timing and sequence for these actions. I look forward to seeing the details later in the teardown.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's nothing beyond motor rotation holding the "Forward" or "Reverse" positions. So as soon as the lever is released (by moving the print carriage out of the special engagement position) a slight bit of paper feed motor movement in the opposite direction will cause the mechanism to snap back into "Neutral". This is a good candidate explanation for the small movement of 1800 encoder counts I saw repeatedly: the printer wants to make sure the paper feed mechanism is in "Neutral" before it does something else.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It should be fun to see how all this is implemented, so I freed the paper feed assembly to get at its gearbox... and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/02/28/mx340-ink-graveyard/">immediately got distracted when I discovered an ink graveyard</a>.</p>
