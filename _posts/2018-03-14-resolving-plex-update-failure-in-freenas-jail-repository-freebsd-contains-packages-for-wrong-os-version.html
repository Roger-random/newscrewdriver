<img class=" size-full wp-image-8410 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/plex-logo-e1446990678679.png" alt="plex-logo-e1446990678679" width="1176" height="459">I've been happily running <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> in a FreeNAS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail">(FreeBSD) Jail</a> for a while, picking up the periodic updates via "pkg update". But now there's a snag. Apparently a breaking change was introduced in a recent FreeNAS update and now binaries in the old jail are out of sync with the underlying operating system. The visible symptom is the following error message trying to run <code>pkg update</code>.</p>
<p><code>pkg: repository FreeBSD contains packages for wrong OS version: FreeBSD:11:amd64</code><br />
<code>Processing entries: 100% </code><br />
<code>Unable to update repository FreeBSD Â </code><br />
<code>Error updating repositories! </code></p>
<p>Thankfully we get a detailed and specific error message. A web search using that error output found this discussion thread on <a href="https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/updated-to-11-1-u1-and-pkg-broken-again-in-jails-again.60936/">FreeNAS user forums</a>, which points to <a href="https://redmine.ixsystems.com/issues/27904">ixsystems issue tracker #27904</a>. Reading the information, this break is not considered a bug in FreeNAS that will be fixed. Instead, the onus is on the user to manually update the jail (<a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-upgrade-freebsd-jail-vps/">pointing to this page on how to do so</a>) or to create a new jail.</p>
<p>After reading over the instructions on updating a jail, it seems easier to create a new jail and migrate my Plex server over to the new instance. None of the media need to be moved because they were a read-only mapping between directories on NAS volume and jail running Plex. It is simple to recreate the mapping after <a href="http://doc.freenas.org/11/jails.html#adding-jails">following FreeNAS manual</a> for creating a new jail.</p>
<p>The only parts that needed moving were Plex server's internal data, which <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/201539237-backing-up-plex-media-server-data/">Plex has documented here</a>. Thankfully there are no tricky database operations involved - it is a straightforward copy operation to transfer from the old jail to the new one.</p>
<p>Once the new jail completed running <code>pkg install plexmediaserver</code>, a quick browse through Plex library seems to show everything is in order. The old Plex jail will be kept around in a non-running state for a while, just in case there's something left behind in the move that we might want retrieve later.</body></html></p>
