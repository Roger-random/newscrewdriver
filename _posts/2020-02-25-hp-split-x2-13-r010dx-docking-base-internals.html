<p>After I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/24/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-tablet-innards/">poked around in the main tablet unit</a> of this convertible laptop, attention shifted to the docking base. There were 9 screws, 4 of which were hidden under rubber feet which had to be removed.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-20594 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-base.jpg" alt="HP Split X2 13-r010dx base" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>Once the screws were removed, only a few tabs held the panel in place. Since the base had functionality in addition to just hosting a keyboard and touchpad, it was not a surprise to find circuit boards near the USB ports, HDMI port, and SD card reader. But there is also a long, much larger than expected, circuit board. This base must be more sophisticated than what I gave it credit for.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-20593 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-base-unused-connector.jpg" alt="HP Split X2 13-r010dx base unused connector" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>An unused connector caught my attention. Typically when a connector is not used, it is not even soldered to the board. (See earlier examination of a potential M.2 connector.) This connector is soldered, but unused. Perhaps supporting a feature of an upscale model or an optional upgrade, but I have no guesses on what it might be.</p>

<p>Another unusual point of interest are these two pieces of metal flanking the touch pad. They appear to serve no electrical or structural purpose, and I speculate they are here just to provide a few grams of weight. Convertible tablets like this device are top-heavy and it's a challenge to prevent them from toppling over backwards when open. Clever geometry could solve most of this problem, but when all else fails, bolt some counterweight to the base far from the hinge for leverage. Some laptop shoppers compare by weight, motivating companies to go to great lengths to reduce overall weight. Adding counterweights negates the effort, so I would guess these were done as a last resort.</p>
<p>There was more inside this base than I had expected. Now that I've looked around the insides, it's time to put this machine back together and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/26/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-first-pass-evaluation/">write down some concluding thoughts</a> before moving on.</p>
