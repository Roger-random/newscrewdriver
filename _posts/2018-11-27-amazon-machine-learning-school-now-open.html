It takes a certain amount of dedication to understand and digest that information. Now, a few decades later, leading edge research can be found on the internet. But even better: many educational resources for people outside those academic fields of study are also available online.</p>
<p>These resources have just grown again, as Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazons-own-machine-learning-university-now-available-to-all-developers/">opened up their AWS Machine Learning</a> course to the world. Formerly a part of internal employee training, it now helps people get up to speed outside the company as well. (And naturally help convert them to become paying AWS customers.)</p>
<p>There are different courses for different audiences, from developers to business professionals. And they cover different parts of AWS services. When I get around to taking these classes (the to-do list never seems to grow shorter...) I'll likely dive into the developer track for visual recognition algorithms. If I feel good about my grasp of the code, I'll see if I can integrate an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens">Amazon DeepLens</a> unit into my robotics projects.</p>
<p>This set of AWS courses is the latest addition to a long list of web-accessible resources for learning latest tools for AI. It's great that I don't need to enroll in school to see how the field has evolved since the time I was at UCLA.</body></html></p>
