<p>Successfully <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/11/segmented-lcd-from-taylor-food-thermometer/">mapping out the segments for a food thermometer LCD</a> had a nice side effect of improving my soldering skills. Armed with this experience, I feel more confident tackling the task of deciphering LCD controller communication protocol. Earlier I had <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/03/powering-up-toyota-audio-head-unit-86120-08010/" target="_blank">successfully reassembled and powered up</a> the circuit boards from a 1998 Toyota Camry LE stock tape deck. Now I intend to go beyond looking at pretty lights and see if I can control its front panel.</p>

<p>That front panel connects to the main board through this connector, which has labelled most of its contact points. Since I want to probe their behavior in a running system, I wanted to preserve the ability to plug it back into the mainboard. I had the soldering iron all warmed up ready to solder to the visible surface-mount contacts above and below this connector, but then I thought of a better idea.</p>

<p>Its mating connector is soldered to the mainboard, and it is a through-hole connector which meant there are exposed pins on the bottom of the mainboard. These pins are finer pitch than the 0.1" I usually work with, but through-hole pins are still more familiar to me than surface mount pads. So I soldered my wires to these pins.</p>

<p>These wires are then brought out to another strip of perforated prototype circuit board, and a row of 0.1" pitch headers.</p>

<p>Which then plug nicely into a breadboard for easy probing and experimentation. Thanks to the labeled connector, I already know which wire is ground so I connected a bare loop for my instruments to use as reference. Next step is to probe the remaining pins to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/13/probing-voltage-range-of-tape-deck-faceplate-interface/">determine their voltage range</a>.</p>
