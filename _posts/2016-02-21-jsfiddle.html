<p>After completing the Codecademy jQuery class, I felt I had a decent overview but wanted more depth. I found that the jQuery project offers a <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/">jQuery Learning Center</a>. I'll likely write a dedicated post once I'm done, but that's not today.</p>
<p>After reading a certain amount of documentation, I start feeling out of touch with the concepts: Too much theory and not enough practice. I tried to create a small project to play with jQuery but I made rookie mistakes with basic boilerplate, wasting a lot of time instead of learning.</p>
<p>That's when I remembered something I saw while reading documentation for the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html">Facebook React</a> project: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>. I don't have enough understanding to use React yet, but they embedded JSFiddle in their documentation so people can play with code as they go.</p>
<p>A fresh fiddle already has the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all properly linked up. To use a framework or extension like jQuery, selecting from a drop-down box activates it with no fussing with tags, links, or URLs. Once the code snippets have been typed in, a click on "Run" will render to the output window. No upload to web server necessary.</p>
<p>This is a huge advantage when testing small pieces of code. No need to get bogged down in repetitious boilerplate, just focus on the interesting bits. I had a great time putting the various bits of theory into practice.</p>
<p>A downside for me was that debugging got messy. When I'm debugging just my own HTML with the browser's built-in debugging tools, I have only a tiny bit of code to examine and all of it is mine.</p>
<p>But when I launch the browser debug tools on a fiddle, the debugger puts the whole JSFiddle page under examination. Even though my code is only a tiny part of the page. It gets tiresome trying to separate out my item of interest from everything else going on with the JSFiddle page.</p>
<p>But still, JSFiddle looks like a great tool for experimentation.</p>
