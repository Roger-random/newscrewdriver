<p>It's somewhat embarrassing to admit my first impressions of Python came from programmer humor. The first one I can recall is <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">xkcd #353</a>. Another one that made an impression was the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/fqtqk/if_programming_languages_were_essays/">If programming languages were essays</a>" series.</p>
<p>The common thread is the tremendous library of tools available to python programmers just a "import" command away. I think the hard part of me getting up to speed in Python won't be the syntax or the constructs, it'll be getting to know what libraries are available. I foresee my biggest hurdle to Python productivity would be spending three hours writing something before it occurs to me to look for a library where someone has already done the work, find it, and finish the task in 15 seconds.</p>
<p>It makes sense that this ecosystem of libraries is a huge strength to Python and also an equally huge liability and a hindrance in transition to Python 3. By breaking backwards compatibility, Python 3 had to rebuild this ecosystem of libraries from scratch. It's hard for people to find motivation to use the new Python 3 - with its limited set of ported libraries - when they could stay with the comfortable group of friends they already know in the Python 2 world.</p>
<p>To learn the ropes, there's nothing like diving right in. I wanted to write a simple script to handle a task I had: enumerate video files in my collection and call <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> to convert them from their old formats to the modern MPEG 4 Video format (h264 + AAC). Most of what I need to do for walking the directory tree comes from "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html">import os</a>" and "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html">import os.path</a>". Calling FFmpeg turns out to be trivial after "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html">import subprocess</a>". And the final icing on the cake: a library to parse command-line parameters using "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">import argparse</a>". Argparse even has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html">HOWTO tutorial</a> to walk me through using it.</p>
<p>In less than an hour, this complete novice was able to build <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/python_tutorials/blob/master/convm4v.py">a decently robust Python script</a> for video conversion. Â Color me impressed.</p>
