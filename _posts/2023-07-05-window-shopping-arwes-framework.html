<p>The reason I want to be able to read JavaScript code written by others, no matter <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/04/javascript-spread-syntax-and-other-un-google-able-shorthand/">what oddball syntax they want to use</a>, is because I want to be able to leverage the huge selection of web development libraries available freely on the internet. I started learning software development in a very commercialized world where everything costs money. Frameworks, components, technical support, sometimes even documentation costs money. But in today's open-source world, the biggest cost is the time spent getting up to speed. I want to have the skill to get up to speed quickly, but I'm definitely not there yet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The latest motivation is a nifty looking web app framework under development called <a href="https://arwes.dev/">Arwes</a>. (<a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/06/29/sci-fi-ui-made-easy-with-arwes/">Heard through Hackaday</a>.) Arwes aims to make it easy to build computer interfaces that resemble fictional interfaces we see in science-fiction movies. This is, of course, much easier said than done. What shows up onscreen in a movie typically only needed to serve the purpose of a single scene. Which means a single interaction path, with a single set of data, towards a single goal. It could easily be a PowerPoint slide deck (and sometimes that's exactly what they are on set.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Real user interfaces have to handle a wide range of interactions, with a wide range of data, and serving multiple possible tasks. Not to mention having to worry about things never seen onscreen like internationalization and accessibility. Trying to make Sci-Fi onscreen interfaces work in a real world capacity usually ends up as a painful exercise. I've seen many efforts to create UI resembling <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS">LCARS interface</a> and it always ends up as something that delivers a poor user experience and inefficient use of screen real estate. And there's the fact copyright around LCARS prevents a free open-source web framework.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I'm confident Arwes will evolve to tackle these and other similar issues. Reading the c<a href="https://arwes.dev/docs">urrent state of documentation</a>, I see there exists a set of "Vanilla" controls for use in any web framework of choice, and a sample implementation of such integration with React.js framework. At the moment I don't know enough to leverage the Vanilla controls directly, and I have yet to learn React. I have more learning ahead of me before I could look at a framework like Arwes and say: "Oh yeah, I know how to use that." That is still my goal and I'll get there <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/06/faux-vfd-experiment-on-codepen/">one small step at a time</a>.</p>
