<p>The paper tray in my retired Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet has a box of mechanisms to orchestrate its page-feeding sequence. Powered by the paper-feed motor, two different actions can be triggered <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/03/02/mx340-paper-feed-gear-shifter/">from a gear shifting mechanism</a> by engaging one of two gears. But there was at least one more gear interaction: The forward gear position can be inhibited by another gear, part of the largest assembly in this box.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I didn't notice this interaction at first, but as I looked at the lever in detail, I noticed a protrusion up top. Given all the design optimizations I've seen so far, I knew that protrusion could not have been accidental. I saw it could push against a wall on the big black gear that covered only roughly 240 degrees out of the circumference. This would inhibit engaging the forward gear.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When within that ~120 degree gap, though, it is possible to engage forward gear. I thought it was neat, but as soon as I looked at this big black gear more closely, I realized that was just the beginning. If the black gear continued turning counter-clockwise in this picture, the wall will eventually push on that protrusion and pop it out of gear.</p>

<p>Beyond the ring of gear teeth, I see a thin piece of plastic covering a different ~120 degree arc. This <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/22/canon-pixma-mx340-print-head-parking-area/">slotted into a photo-interrupter sensor</a>. Looking at the two mechanisms, it appears the beam is interrupted when we're within the arc where forward gear engagement is allowed.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/canon-pixma-mx340-paper-feed-gearbox-big-black-gear-layers.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-42239"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Which led me to the next question: why would the angle matter in a spinning gear? The answer can be found in layers attached below this big black gear. I saw two white plastic gears, but they didn't have teeth all the way around. Both are missing teeth (roughly 45-60 degrees worth) at different positions. Adjacent to one side of this gap, 5 gear teeth are mounted on an unsupported arch while remaining gear teeth are mounted rigidly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I interpret this as a mechanism that can convey motion for part of a rotation before falling into a gap. To re-engage the gears, it would have to turn in the direction of those arch-mounted teeth. Taking advantage of their slight bit of flexibility to help gears mesh back up instead of grinding like a student driver learning a manual transmission car. I never noticed any gear-grinding noises from this machine so I guess it works and reliable enough for years of service.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Attached below the pair of intentionally incomplete gears is another piece of black plastic. A cam mechanism with contours to move arms that actuate mechanisms in the paper tray. The "top" side visible in above picture controls the large spring-loaded flap of the paper tray (labeled "1" below) and the "bottom" side of this cam has two separate contours for manipulating two other mechanisms ("2" and "3").</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All this added up to a lot of mechanical sophistication attached below that big black gear. What I had thought was just another gear in the gear train turned out to be the output shaft for coordinating many separate actions related to feeding a sheet from the paper tray. It even incorporated <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/03/04/mx340-paper-tray-freewheel-gears/">a freewheel mechanism</a>, something I overlooked at first.</p>
