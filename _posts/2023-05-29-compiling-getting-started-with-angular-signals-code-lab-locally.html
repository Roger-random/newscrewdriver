<p>It was easy to follow "Getting Started with Angular Signals" tasks with the online StackBlitz development environment, but as a practice exercise I wanted to get it up and running on my own computer. This turned out to be more challenging than expected, with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/28/installing-getting-started-with-angular-signals-code-lab-locally/">several problems I had to fix</a> before I could install dependencies on my computer with "<code>npm install</code>".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Successful installation of project dependencies moved me to the next part of the challenge: Angular project issues. Running "<code>ng serve</code>" resulted in the following error:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"10px"}}} --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code" style="font-size:10px"><code>Error: Schema validation failed with the following errors:
  Data path "" must have required property 'tsConfig'.</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no filename associated with this error message, so it took a lot of wrong turns before I found the answer. I compared files between my Compass project and this demo project and eventually figured out this was referring to the <code>"build"/"options"</code> section in <code>angular.json</code>. In my Compass project, I had a "<code>tsConfig</code>" entry pointing to a file <code>tsconfig.app.json</code>. This code lab exercise project's <code>angular.json</code> is missing that entry and missing the file <code>tsconfig.app.json</code>. I copied both from my Compass project to reach the next set of errors:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"10px"}}} --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code" style="font-size:10px"><code>Error: src/cipher/cipher.ts:1:21 - error TS2305: Module '"@angular/core"' has no exported member 'effect'.

1 import { Component, effect, OnInit } from '@angular/core';</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is just the first of several errors, all complaining that the newfangled Angular signal mechanisms <code>signal</code>, <code>computed</code>, and <code>effect</code> were missing from <code>@angular/core</code>. Well, of course they wouldn't be. The <code>packages.json</code> file specified Angular 15, and signals were one of the new touted features of Angular 16. Running "<code>ng update</code>" I was informed of the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"10px"}}} --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code" style="font-size:10px"><code>Using package manager: npm

    We analyzed your package.json, there are some packages to update:

     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      @angular/cdk                       15.2.9 -&gt; 16.0.1         ng update @angular/cdk
      @angular/cli                       15.2.8 -&gt; 16.0.2         ng update @angular/cli
      @angular/core                      15.2.9 -&gt; 16.0.3         ng update @angular/core
      @angular/material                  15.2.9 -&gt; 16.0.1         ng update @angular/material</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So I ran "<code>ng update @angular/cdk @angular/cli @angular/core @angular/material</code>". It was mostly successful but there was one error:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"10px"}}} --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code" style="font-size:10px"><code>Migration failed: Tsconfig cannot not be read: /src/tsconfig.spec.json
  See "/tmp/ng-QdC8Cc/angular-errors.log" for further details.</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Judging by the "<code>spec.json</code>" suffix this has something to do with Angular testing and I will choose to ignore that error. Now when I run "ng serve" I no longer get complaints about missing Angular signal mechanisms. I get syntax errors instead:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"10px"}}} --></p>

<p>This sample project has component CSS as string literals inside the TypeScript source code files. This is a valid approach, but these bits of CSS were broken. For the first one, the paragraph style didn't have a closing brace, exactly as the error message complained. Adding a closing brace resolved that error. The second stylesheet error used double-slash comment style which isn't how CSS comments work. Changing that over to <code>/* comment */</code> style resolved that error. After all of those changes, the little cipher app is up and running onscreen with some visual errors relative to what I saw for the same project StackBlitz.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How did StackBlitz run despite these problems? I'm going to guess that it has its own default <code>tsconfig</code> and did not require one to be specified. In the repository <code>package.json</code> I see that <code>@angular/core</code> was specified as "<code>next</code>". Apparently StackBlitz interpreted that to be something new that included signals, whereas my local machine decided "<code>next</code>" is the same "<code>15.2.9</code>" as everything else which did not. As for the CSS syntax errors... I have no guesses and that remains a mystery to me.</p>

<p>But at least now I have something running locally, and I got a useful exercise understanding and fixing Angular build errors. Now onward to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/30/running-getting-started-with-angular-signals-code-lab-locally/">fixing runtime errors</a>.</p>
