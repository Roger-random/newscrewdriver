<p>After verifying my clothes dryer's motor <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/07/07/maytag-dryer-mdg9206awa-mechanical-base/">couldn't even turn its own shaft in the absence of load</a>, I was confident replacing the motor assembly will restore my dryer to working condition. I started looking online for this motor part number and came up empty, and soon realized this was due to an obfuscated ecosystem of appliance repair parts. There is a wide variety of part numbers, and certain ones are supposed to replace certain other parts. I'm not in favor or such an opaque system and realized I need some kind of help to navigate it.</p>

<p>That's when I snapped out of my online shopping indoctrination and started searching for a local resource. After all, washers and dryers have been around (and been failing) long before the advent of online shopping, surely I could find a local vendor of appliance parts. I expect them to mostly cater to local repair experts as they do their house calls, but a subset of these vendors should also be willing to sell at retail to DIY consumers like myself. I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.coastparts.com/" target="_blank">Coast Appliance Parts Co.</a> with a location near me and decided to visit them first.</p>

<p>At the service counter, I gave my dryer model number MDG9206AWA and the store employee was able to put that into their computer system to retrieve some part numbers as replacements. Thankfully they were in stock so I bought a replacement motor assembly plus a replacement belt. Neither of which had a model number that matched the original item on my dryer, even though they were packaged in a way consistent with official replacement parts. Why appliance manufacturers use such a convoluted system I don't know, but at least I have a way to deal with it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, mismatching part number aside, both the motor and the belt seem to be straightforward replacements for their original counterparts. Once I installed the motor by itself I verified it could at least spin itself in the absence of a load, confirming the old motor assembly was indeed faulty. From there I could put everything back together in the reverse order of assembly, and my dryer was back up and running!</p>

<p>Now I can resume doing laundry at home, and also <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/07/09/dell-xps-m1330-led-backlight/">resume my quest to salvage LED backlights</a> from old LCD panels.</p>
