<p>I'm making slow progress learning to work with surface mount electronics, but I still have a long way to go. This retired BlueAnt Q3 Bluetooth headset is a marvel of miniaturization and a reminder of how far behind the state of the art I am. Even more when considering that, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/blueant-q3-review/">judging by this product review I found online</a>, this device is getting close to ten years old! Since that time BlueAnt seems to have stopped making this product category, with nothing similar currently <a href="https://blueant.com.au/">listed on their page</a>.</p>

<p>This particular unit came to me already disassembled by someone else, but I think its battery was the only notable item missing. The mechanical design is very impressively intricate, integrating several controls that had to be big enough for a human figure to manipulate. But it's the electronics that really shine.</p>

<li>This is a micro-USB port for charging. It also gives a scale perspective on how tiny everything is.</li>
<li>Speaker</li>
<li>Push button</li>
<li>Dual LED module with a white LED and red LED sharing a single package. I would have expected such a thing to share either a common anode or a common cathode but that's not the case here. This little yellow rectangle has four pads. One anode and one cathode for each of the two LEDs.</li>
<li>MIC1 and MIC2 are the two microphones used for noise cancellation and other nifty features.</li>
<li>Three-position toggle switch. It is the same size as the power switch used on Mr. Robot Badge. What's tiny on that circuit board takes a significant percentage of real estate on this one.</li>
<li>I think this curved piece might be an antenna?</li>
</ol>

<p>Between 6 and 7 we see several unpopulated pads. I don't know if there are different lines to the BlueAnt Q3 for additional features, or if they represented features that they've cut from the product.</p>

<p>Flipping over, we see the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":8} --></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>IC that runs the show.</li>
<li>Debug headers.</li>
<li>BT1 and BT2 are good candidates for battery terminals. I'm a bit annoyed they didn't mark them BT+ and BT-. If I were trying to repair this device, I risk reversing battery polarity and damaging the device.</li>
<li>This is a really cool control I hadn't seen before. The nub sticking out to the right is a switch that can be moved above or below the center position, and a spring-loaded mechanism pulls it back to center once released. In addition to that, the cream-colored center circle might be a push button. It certainly gives the tactile "click" appropriate for a button when pushed. Together they are a completely self-contained unit for up/down/select menu control. I would love to play with it some more, except for the fact that it is <em>tiny</em>. That center circle is only 2mm in diameter, and this device has at least 13 little soldering points holding it on the circuit board. With my current skill level, I would destroy the device trying to remove it from the board. But since this is tiny, I can keep the board and try later once I have better tools. Perhaps a hot plate can simultaneously melt all the solder without damaging the plastic?</li>
