<!-- wp:paragraph --><html><body></p>
<p>The full scope of PWA (Progressive Web App) is too much for me to comprehend with my limited web development skills. Fortunately, I don't need to. PWA helper libraries exist, including some tailored to specific web frameworks. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/04/29/notes-on-angular-service-workers-pwa-guide/">Reading over a developer guide for Angular framework's PWA helper</a>, I understood it offers basic PWA service worker functionality without much effort. Naturally, I had to give it a try and see how it turns my Compass project, a simple practice Angular web app, into a PWA.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Following instructions, I ran "<code>ng add @angular/pwa</code>" in my project and looked over <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/compass/commit/a19d872651b4055ae8a67869c3e7e3385235b660">the changes it made</a>. As expected, there were several modifications to configuration JSON files on top of adding one of their own <code>ngsw-config.json</code>. Eight placeholder icon PNG files (showing the Angular logo) were added to the source tree, each representing a different resolution from 72x72 up to 512x512. Notably, the only TypeScript source code change was in <code>app.module.ts</code> to register service worker file <code>ngsw-worker.js</code>, and that service worker file is not part of the source tree where we can enhance it. And if there's an extension mechanism, I don't see it. This tells me behavioral changes are limited to what we can affect via settings in <code>ngsw-config.json</code>. For app authors that want to go beyond, they'd have to write their own PWA service worker from scratch.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But I don't have any ambition of code changes in this first run. I replaced those placeholder icon PNG files. Change them from the Angular logo to a crude compass I whipped up in a few minutes. Plus a few edits to the application name and cosmetic theme color. (Duplicated in two locations: the <code>.webmanifest</code> file and in <code>index.html</code>.) I built the results, <a href="https://roger-random.github.io/compass">deployed to GitHub Pages</a>, and brought it up on my Android phone Chrome browser to see if anything looks different.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Good news: Android Chrome recognized the site is available as a PWA and offered the option to install it. (Adding yet another browser interface bar to the clutter...) I clicked install, and my icon in all its crudeness was added to my Android home screen.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Bad news: I tapped the icon, saw the loading splash screen (with an even bigger version of my crude icon in the middle) and then... nothing. It was stuck at the splash screen.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I killed the app and tried a second time, which was successful: my compass needle came up on screen after a brief pause. (1-2 seconds at most.) I returned to home screen, tapped the icon again, and it came up instantly. Implying the app was suspended and resumed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A few hours later, I tapped the icon again. It was apparently no longer suspended and no longer available for resume, because I saw the splash screen again and it got stuck again. Killing the app and immediately trying again was successful.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The observed pattern is thus: Initial launch would get stuck at the splash screen due to an undiagnosed issue. Killing the stuck app and immediately relaunching would be successful. Suspend and resume works, but if a suspended app is terminated, we're back to the initial launch problem upon relaunch.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since it wasn't possible to change any code in <code>@angular/pwa</code> I'm not sure what I did wrong. Following instructions for "<em><a href="https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-devops#debugging-the-angular-service-worker">Debugging the Angular service worker</a></em>" I headed over to the <a href="https://roger-random.github.io/compass/ngsw/state">debug endpoint ngsw/state</a> where I saw it couldn't download <code>favicon.ico</code> from the server. (Full debug output error message below.) I could see <a href="https://roger-random.github.io/compass/favicon.ico">the file exists</a> on the server, so I don't understand why this PWA service worker could not download it. At the moment I'm at a loss as to how to diagnose this further. For today I'm going to declare a partial success and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/01/nokia-lumia-520-rm-915-teardown/">move on</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>[UPDATE: I've figured it out. By default the PWA service worker assumes the app was deployed to server root, which in this case was incorrect. Since it is hosted at <code>https://roger-random.github.io/compass/</code> I needed to run "<code>ng deploy --base-href /compass/</code>"]</p>
