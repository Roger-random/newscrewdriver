<p>I had <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/14/integrated-test-failed-due-to-interference/">a minor setback</a> in my project to upgrade my 2004 Mazda RX-8's in-car navigation capability from the now-ancient factory integrated system. But despite the setback, I have a usable system. Enough to declare this as successful completion of project phase one. By removing the navigation map display unit, and installing a standalone wireless CarPlay/Android Auto receiver in its place, I now experience the following advantages:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Connects to my Pixel 7 phone via wireless Android Auto, so now my in-car navigation screen has access to up-to-date maps and traffic information.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Audio entertainment including music or podcasts can stream from my phone.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>User interaction such as setting a destination for navigation can be done via my phone's highly responsive touchscreen. It's superior to the sluggish receiver touchscreen and <strong><em>far </em></strong>superior to the factory system of painstakingly typing an address via joystick-controlled on-screen keyboard.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These items were left unchanged, and they were important project criteria:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Factory appearance with no visible alteration to interior trim. When the car is turned off, the only visible difference is the new receiver has a glossy screen whereas the factory LCD had a matte surface.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>All in-car controls were maintained, including volume control both via center console and steering wheel buttons.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were several functional regressions:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Due to electrical interference, I had to disconnect the factory motor retract mechanism. I'm optimistic I can regain this functionality as a future phase of the project.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>When the factory system loses GPS signal, it can estimate position based on vehicle speed and direction. The new receiver is GPS-only and helpless when signal is lost. I don't see any way to restore this functionality, but it's not a high priority to do so.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The factory system automatically dims the display when headlights are on, and when the light sensor detects low ambient light. The new receiver's brightness must be manually adjusted. I don't see any way to restore the headlight response functionality with this receiver. However, buying a different Android Auto receiver with a built-in light sensor may restore auto-dimming capability.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Potential future phases for this project:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Restore the factory motor retract mechanism. Fortunately, Mazda engineers designed the geartrain to be back drivable. Or in plainer language, I could still adjust the angle manually without damaging either the motor or its gears. This will be important if a headlight or sunlight is inconveniently angled to reflect off that glossy screen into my eyes: I can still reach out to change that angle.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Install the backup camera that came bundled with the receiver. [UPDATE: <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/09/rx-8-navigation-upgrade-project-phase-two-backup-camera/">completed as phase 2</a>.]</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Install a power switch for times when I don't want that screen.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Remove/repurpose other components of the factory navigation system. Including the control panel just behind the shifter, and the map data DVD drive + navigation computer between the rear seats.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For now, I will use the system as-is without the motor retract mechanism. See what other problems crop up during use so I could solve them before going further.</p>
