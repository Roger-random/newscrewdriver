<p>I've decided to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/15/new-project-as7341-interactive-web-ui/">build an interactive AS7341 explorer application</a> using web-based technologies, shifting most of the interactive input and visual output to a web browser. But web-based technologies are not able to communicate directly to an AS7341 via I2C, so I still need something to bridge the hardware to the browser. The answer is a small ESP32 Arduino Core sketch using Adafruit's AS7341 library on one side and a web server library on the other.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the interest of starting simple, I used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/WebServer" target="_blank">the WebServer library</a> included as part of ESP32 Arduino Core. This is a simple implementation of HTTP server that can only handle a single connection at a time, but its limited features also meant simple code. I started with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/libraries/WebServer/examples/HelloServer/HelloServer.ino" target="_blank">the HelloServer example</a> which does everything I need: parse arguments and send a response. The most informative section is the handler for "HTTP 404 Not Found", as this is where it prints out all the arguments parsed out of the URI and serves as a handy reference to do the same in my implementation. I wanted to be able to pass in AS7341 parameters "atime" and "astep" to control sensor exposure time, "gain" for sensitivity, and "led_ma" to control brightness of illumination LED. These parameters are passed directly into Adafruit AS7341 API.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My first iteration would turn on LED just for the duration of sensor integration then turn it off. But when I read the sensor continuously in a loop, this would result in an annoying flash between reads. To address this problem, I added a "led_stay_on" parameter to control whether the illumination LED would stay on between reads.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once sensor integration is complete, I packaged readings for sensors F1-F8, Clear, and NIR into a JSON formatted string and returned it to caller as mime type <code>application/json</code>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"10px"}}} --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code" style="font-size:10px"><code>{
  "415nm" : 7,
  "445nm" : 22,
  "480nm" : 31,
  "515nm" : 65,

  "590nm" : 175,
  "630nm" : 243,
  "680nm" : 125,
  "clear" : 408,
  "nir" : 28,
  "settings" : {
    "atime" : 10,
    "astep" : 599,
    "gain" : 64,
    "led_ma" : 0
  }
}</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In hindsight, using an ESP32 was overkill: an ESP8266 would have been perfectly capable of serving as a HTTP to I2C bridge. But I already had this ESP32 ready to go, so I stayed with it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If I want capabilities beyond what that simple WebServer library could do, in the future I could swap it out for something more powerful like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer" target="_blank">the ESPAsyncWebServer library</a>. It includes a templating feature so I wouldn't have to do as much direct string manipulation. It also includes the ArduinoJson library for simpler and more robust JSON formatting instead of the string operations I used. And finally, it includes WebSocket capability which would be very useful if I want to migrate the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/04/16/shiny-new-esp32-websocket-support/" target="_blank">messy ESP-IDF code I wrote for my ESP32 Sawppy controller</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But for today, simple WebServer should be enough to let <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/17/basic-browser-ui-for-as7341/">get me started on browser side code</a>.</p>
