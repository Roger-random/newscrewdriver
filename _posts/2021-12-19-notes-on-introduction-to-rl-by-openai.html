<p>With some confidence that I could <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/18/old-pytorch-without-gpu-is-enough-to-start/">practice simple reinforcement learning algorithms</a>, I moved on to what I consider the meat of OpenAI's <em>Spinning Up in Deep RL</em> guide: the section titled <em>Introduction to RL</em>. I thought it was pretty good stuff.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-key-concepts-in-rl"><a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 1: Key Concepts in RL</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<p>Since I had been marginally interested in the field, the first section <em>What Can RL Do?</em> was mostly review for me. More than anything else, it confirmed that I was reading the right page. This section proceeded to <em>Key Concepts and Terminology</em> and that quickly caught up then surpassed what knowledge I already had. I was fine with the verbal descriptions and the code snippets, but once the author started phrasing in terms of equations it became more abstract than what I can easily follow. I'm a code person, not an equations person. Given my difficulty comprehending the formalized equations, I was a little bemused at the third section <em>(Optional) Formalism</em> as things were already becoming more formalized than my usual style.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-kinds-of-rl-algorithms"><a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 2: Kinds of RL Algorithms</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<p>Given that I didn't comprehend everything in part 1, I was a little scared at what I would find in part 2. Gold. I found pure gold. Here I found a quick survey of major characteristics of various reinforcement learning approaches, explaining those terms in ways I (mostly) understood. Explanations like what "Model-Free" vs. "Model-Based" means. What "on-policy" vs. "off-policy" means. I had seen a lot of these terms thrown around in things I read before, but I never found a place laying them down against one another until I found this section. This section alone was worth the effort of digging into this guide and will help me understand other things. For example, a lot of these terms were in the documentation for Unity ML-Agents. I didn't understand what they meant at the time, but now I hope to understand more when I review them.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<p>Cheered by how informative I found part 2, I proceeded to part 3 and was promptly brought back down to size by the equations. The good thing is that this section had both equations and a code example implementation, and they were explained more or less in parallel. Someone like myself can read the code and try to understand the equations. I expect there are people out there who are the reverse, more comfortable with the equations and appreciate seeing what they look like in code. That said, I can't claim I completely understand the code, either. Some of the mathematical complexities represented in the equations were not in the sample source code: They were handed off to implementations in PyTorch library.</p>

<p>I foresee a lot of studying PyTorch documentation before I can get proficient at writing something new on my own. But just from reading this <em>Introduction to RL</em> section, I have the basic understanding to navigate PyTorch API documentation and maybe the skill to apply existing implementations written by somebody else. And as expected of an introduction, there are <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/20/notes-on-deep-reinforcement-learning-resources-by-openai/">tons of links to more resources</a>.</p>
