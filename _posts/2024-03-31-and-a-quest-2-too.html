<p>One reason I was willing to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/03/30/hp-windows-mixed-reality-controller/">take apart my old HP Windows Mixed Reality system</a> is the Meta Quest 2. Now with the Quest 3 taking mainstream position in their product line, Quest 2 inventory is getting cleared out at $200. That price was too tempting to resist so I got one even though I had a perfectly functional Valve Index. Here are some notes from my first hand experience.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Versus HP Windows Mixed Reality</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I did not find a single spec sheet advantage my old WMR headset had over the much younger Quest 2. Technology moves fast! Quest 2 has higher screen resolution, integrated microphone and headset, and controllers that were happy to run on a single nominal AA battery instead of demanding two fully-charged AAs. Both used camera-based inside-out tracking but Quest 2 maintained better tracking because it used four cameras instead of two, and those cameras did not demand I turn on every light in the house if I wanted to use it at night. Quest 2 had some level of IPD adjustment with three settings, whereas the HP had no IPD adjustment at all.</p>

<p>I have not yet decided if I prefer Quest 2's elastic headband versus HP WMR's headband. I think the HP headband was the best part of the device and I may try 3D printing an adapter to use it with my Quest 2 to see if that's an improvement.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Versus Valve Index</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the spec sheet Valve Index has a resolution advantage to the Quest 2. Fewer display pixels spread out across a wider field of view. In practice, I found the wider field of view much more important for immersive VR. I am happy making the tradeoff for better field of view but obviously I wouldn't say no to both if I can get it in a future headset.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Beacon-based tracking used by Index meant I had to add those two little boxes in my room, but the results are worth it. Index has consistently better tracking especially for games where my hands have to move out of my field of view. (Reach behind my back or have a hand on my chest while looking up.) The Index controllers themselves are also much better than Quest controllers, with individual finger sensing, grip pressure sensing, and straps allowing me to open my grip without the controllers falling out. It's a great immersion advantage, too bad <em>Half Life: Alyx</em> is the only game that takes full advantage of Index controllers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Both have integrated microphone and speakers, but the Valve Index delivered much better positional audio. Weight of an Index is significantly heavier but part of that weight is the headband balancing things across my head versus Quest 2's thin elastic band. And finally, Index has better optical adjustment capabilities. Not only smooth IPD adjustment (instead of three fixed positions) but also fore-aft adjustment.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Index is a much more comfortable headset for longer sessions and provides a more immersive VR experience compared to a Quest 2. But we have to consider their relative price tags. It's better, but it's not <em>five times</em> better. Even more if you count cost of a gaming PC! Plus, the comparisons here overlook what's arguably Quest 2's greatest advantage: <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/01/quest-2-standalone-and-mixed-reality-operation/">it doesn't need an associated gaming PC</a> at all.</p>
