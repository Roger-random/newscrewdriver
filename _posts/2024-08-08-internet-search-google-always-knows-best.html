<p>One advantage of having my own domain like https://newscrewdriver.com is that I can subscribe to search engine services that provide feedback on how they process a site. Microsoft has <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmasters"><em>Bing Webmaster Tools</em></a>, Google has <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console"><em>Google Search Console</em></a>, etc. These are products focused on helping websites improve their chances of showing up in internet search results. An important objective for many sites, but not this one because I'm not trying to maximize revenue or anything here. I set up my dashboards because I was curious what information was available and what search giants expect site owners to do about it. Not that I can, for the most part, because majority of site implementation details here are handled by WordPress and out of my direct control.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Every once in a while I would receive a notification that some problem prevented a part of my site from search indexing. Most of these were caused by a change in WordPress and are quickly fixed with no action on my part. Sometimes the notification reflect a big attitude change in how Google thinks about the web and want sites to follow along. For example, a few years back Google decided a site's treatment of mobile devices is more important than desktop, so sites are encouraged to have a good mobile experience or else their Google search ranking would take a hit. This was a change I agree with: making sites usable on small screens with slow processors and low bandwidth makes the web more accessible to all, and wielding Google search ranking as a stick to encourage adoption is one way to use Google power for good.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But then there are times that make me... less fond... of Google. I just received an error notification: "<em>Duplicate, Google chose different canonical than user</em>" with <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7440203#google_chose_different_canonical_than_user">a link to this explanation</a>. As I understand it, the error says that Google looked at the URL listed in my WordPress-generated site map and decided a different URL was better. I thought that was odd, but whatever. I went looking for a way to inform Google their decision was wrong, and I can't. Google has decided they know my site better than I do and the "fix" is to change my site to use their chosen URL. Conform to Google. There is no alternative.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this specific case, the URL was to one of my posts and Google's chosen URL was to the comments section on that same page. Google is wrong, their link is not the superior link, but they will not hear arguments on their decision. Stalemate. I guess Google will keep using their wrong URL. Looking on the bright side, at least that URL actually points to my content, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/08/09/internet-search-nonsensical-plagiarists/">unlike some other search engines</a>.</p>
