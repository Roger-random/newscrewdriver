<p>I was curious about PC accessories with embedded addressable RGB LED, so I bought the cheapest item available on Newegg that day. I have <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/31/asiahorse-magic-i-120-v2/">verified it works as originally intended</a>, and now I'm going to dig deeper. This <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.newegg.com/asiahorse-fs-9002-3pack-case-fan-accessory/p/1YF-00SS-00044?Item=9SIAJ00DP06171" target="_blank">Asiahorse Magic-i 120 V2</a> is a three-pack of 120mm fans with integrated LEDs. All three fans plug into a hub that has a corresponding remote control for me to select from a list of programmed patterns. This bundle is fine if I'm satisfied with those patterns, but I want display patterns of my own.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>

<p>Each fan connects to the hub through this six-wire connector. The distance between each pin is 2mm. Judging by the pitch and physical appearance, I guess they are <a href="https://www.jst.com/products/crimp-style-connectors-wire-to-board-type/ph-connector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JST-PH</a> or a clone. (I don't have any 6-conductor JST-PH to verify.) This is mildly inconvenient because my workbench is setup to work with 0.1" pitch (~2.54mm) connectors so it's not very easy for me to probe those signals as-is.</p>

<p>The solution is a quick soldering project to give me an exploration board. I cut the bundle of six wires and inserted a small piece of perforated prototype board. Each of the six wires are then bridged with an exposed length of solid wire, easy for me to clip probes onto.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Trying the easy thing first, I probed for continuity between these six wires and the power input wires. This gave me location for +12V source, +5V source, and ground. Armed with this information, I soldered capacitors to smooth out both power rails, because the AC adapter I'm using is designed for far higher wattage than a few LEDs and it's not unusual for switching power supplies to be noisy at low power levels. (And the cheap ones are always noisy at all power levels...)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With three out of six wires identified for power, this left me with three more wires to decipher. Here are my candidates:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fan control</strong>: it may be one (or none) of the following:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fan motor high side</strong>: the fan may be internally connected to the ground wire, and the high side wire is left exposed here for external PWM or on/off control with a power transistor.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fan motor low side</strong>: the same idea but reverse: fan motor is internally connected to +12V and the low side is exposed here for external PWM or on/off control with a power transistor.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fan motor PWM</strong>: Neither of the above. Instead of leaving either high or low side unconnected for external power transistor, a suitable power transistor is built into the fan and controlled with a 25kHz PWM signal <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/24/cpu-cooling-4-wire-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as used in 4-wire fans</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fan tachometer</strong> like the type <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/08/computer-cooling-fan-tachometer-wire/" target="_blank">I found in 3-wire fans</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>LED Data In</strong>: addressable RGB signal input.</li>
<li>
<strong>LED Data Out</strong>: signal that has passed through the LED string inside this device and ready to be passed on to other LEDs in other devices down the chain.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To decipher which wires are which of those candidate capabilities, I connected my Saleae Logic 8 to the three unknown wires. I started an analog waveform capture session and used the fan remote control to command that all fans show a solid green.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/asiahorse-fan-control-analog-capture.jpg?w=953" alt="" class="wp-image-31762"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The top line in white stayed at 0V through the entire session. This may be the tachometer wire, or it may be fan motor low side. To determine which, I disconnected everything other than the +12V and ground wires. The fan did not move. I connected the wire corresponding to this white line to ground, and the fan started spinning. Conclusion: this wire is <strong>fan motor low side</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The middle line in brown shows a distinct repeating pattern. The bottom line in red shows the same repeating pattern, but delayed by 12 cycles. Since there are 12 LEDs in a fan, that means the middle brown line is <strong>LED Data In</strong> and the red line is <strong>LED Data Out</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To verify LED Data In, I connected +5V, ground, plus this wire to the data pin of a Pixelblaze. After I configured the Pixelblaze to emit control signal for a string of 12 x WS2812 (NeoPixel) LEDs, I saw them light up appropriately on the fan.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To verify LED Data Out, I connected it to the data input pin of an array of 64 WS2812 LEDs. I configured the Pixelblaze for 12 + 64 = 76 pixels. After colorful pixels cycle through the fan, they marched onwards to the array as appropriate for LED Data Out.</p>

<p>With these functions verified, I'm confident enough to describe this <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/08/02/pinout-for-asiahorse-120mm-fan-magic-i-120-v2/">Asiahorse fan pinout</a>.</p>
