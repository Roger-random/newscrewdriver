<p>When I went shopping for new batteries to replace worn 7AH sealed lead-acid (SLA) batteries in my APC uninterruptible power supply (UPS), <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/27/lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-in-commodity-sealed-lead-acid-battery-form-factor/">I saw listings for an interesting alternative</a>: Lithium-iron phosphate batteries (LiFePO4 or LFP) packaged in the 7AH SLA form factor with a built-in battery protection circuit, advertised to be drop-in upgrades for systems designed to run on SLA batteries. They offer many advantages and cost more but, if they last longer, there's a chance LFP batteries would be more economical long term. I thought it was worth a try and ordered <a href="https://amzn.to/471pPpc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a two-pack from the lowest Amazon bidder of the day</a>. (*)</p>

<p>Here is the "before" picture, my worn APC RBC cartridge and the two 7AH SLA form factor LFP batteries I intend to upgrade to.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The APC cartridge is held together by front and rear sheets of adhesive-backed plastic. This unit didn't peel as cleanly as <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/31/apc-rbc-battery-module-teardown/">the last time I did this</a>, but came apart just the same. Under these label we can see they used Vision CP 1270 batteries, a different subcontractor from the previous batch.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After the front and back sheets of plastic were removed, both sets of connectors are easily accessible. I swapped out the batteries and reused the wire, connectors, and plastic bracket in between the batteries.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I weighed the batteries just for curiosity's sake. Each 7AH SLA battery weighed 2072 grams, more than double the 940 grams of their LFP counterpart.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm sure these terminal connectors are only rated for a limited number of plug-unplug cycles, but here I'm only up to two cycles so I should be OK. If these ever start causing problems, there are vendors <a href="https://amzn.to/3Q4oszf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling just the center parts</a> (*) for people who want to build RBC-compatible cartridges from scratch.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After verifying voltage and polarity of the output terminals, I was satisfied this upgraded cartridge is electrically sound and proceeded to mechanical structural integrity. I don't have the big fancy sheets of adhesive-backed plastic, but I do have a roll of clear packing tape that should suffice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Everything seemed fine when I plugged it in. These batteries shipped only partially charged so I left the UPS plugged in for 24 hours to give it plenty of time to charge up to full. Or actually, the lead-acid standby voltage of 13.8V, which is less than full for these LFP batteries. But "less than full" was exactly what I wanted in the hope of prolonging their useful life. Despite this caveat I expect I'll still get plenty of battery runtime out of this setup, an expectation <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/29/first-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-runtime-test/">that needs to be tested</a>.</p>
