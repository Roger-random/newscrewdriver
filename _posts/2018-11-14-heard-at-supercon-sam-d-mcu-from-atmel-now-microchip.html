<p>One of the best parts of attending Hackaday Supercon is the opportunity to chat with other like-minded people and see what they find interesting. Because odds are good that I'll find it interesting, too. A prime example this year was hearing about the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit/sam-32-bit-mcus/sam-d-mcus">SAM D series of microcontrollers</a> developed by Atmel. It is now branded a Microchip product due to acquisition.</p>
<p>Since I was spending most of my time in the badge hacking area, "talking shop" usually meant talking about microcontrollers in one context or another. The heart of the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/161859-2018-hackaday-superconference-badge">Hackaday Superconference 2018 badge</a> is a PIC32 processor, which doesn't seem to be particularly well-regarded among the people I talked to. I personally pledge no particular allegiance to one chip over another - my philosophy is that they're all tools with their own advantages and disadvantages. But that's not the same opinion held by everyone, and it's interesting to hear other opinions.</p>
<p>The PIC32 is a completely different architecture from the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/hardware-platforms/pic-microcontrollers/">8-bit PICs I've played with earlier.</a>. PIC32 aim for a higher tier of products with higher functionality but also higher price. I had been aware of Atmel's AVR line of chips, though I have yet to play with them firsthand. As head-to-head competitor with Microchip PIC for many years, they too have a low-end 8-bit offering and a high-end AVR32 line. I was also aware that ARM-based chips like those used in the Raspberry Pi and my cell phone occupies an even higher tier, though they could reach as low as PIC32/AVR32 tier.</p>
<p>I was wrong: They can actually be downsized even further than that! I did not know ARM can be so flexible until conversations at Supercon. Chips with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M#Cortex-M0">Cortex-M0 core</a> can be price and feature competitive with 8-bit PICs and AVRs. One such example being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_ARM-based_processors#SAM_D">SAM D series of controllers</a>. The lowest end<a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/embedded-microcontrollers/685?k=SAM+D10&amp;k=&amp;pkeyword=SAM+D10&amp;pv1989=0&amp;sf=0&amp;FV=ffe002ad&amp;quantity=&amp;ColumnSort=0&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=25"> SAM D10 is available from Digi-Key</a> for roughly a dollar each. They're not available in a breadboard-friendly DIP form factor for experimentation, but that can be mitigated by relatively inexpensive development breakout boards like the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATSAMD10-XMINI">SAM D10 Xplained</a> pictured below.</p>
<p>And the best part of learning this as part of a friendly Supercon crowd: When I honestly said I didn't know about the SAM D series, I didn't get an elitist "Oh you don't know? You are so out of touch" response, I got an excited welcoming "Oh you don't know? Well now you have something new and fun to explore!" This attitude makes a huge difference in community building.</p>
