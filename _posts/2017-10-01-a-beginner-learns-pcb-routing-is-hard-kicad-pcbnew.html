<p>Drawing up the circuit diagram/schematic was a new thing, but I got through it with minimal headaches and was feeling pretty good about using KiCad. After I was done with the first draft, I moved on to route all the connections to be placed on the printed circuit board (PCB). Doing this,Â I get firsthand experience that wire routing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_(electronic_design_automation)">is a hard problem</a>.</p>
<p>The first few connections were easy, but then it got progressively more difficult as I struggled to find a route for the later connections. The center of the board inevitably became a traffic jam and I started having to go around the jam. Every track that go around the outside perimeter of the PCB is a surrender that I couldn't find a better way.</p>
<p>In addition to the traces going around the outside perimeter, another way to quantify my frustration with my circuit is the number of tracks in the KiCad PCB file. This is a number easily readable in the text format save file.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it doesn't cost anything to learn by doing, redoing, and repeat.</p>
<p>The first attempt was a hopeless mess and I had to abort before I could connect everything. Here is version 2, where everything is actually connected with almost 200 tracks and multiple traces that go around the perimeter in a last-ditch effort.</p>

<p>Version 3 changed the layout of the components in an attempt to make routing simpler. Moved the LEDs to the top, etc. It felt cleaner but is still quite a mess. I managed to avoid long traces that went around the left and right perimeters, but I still needed several at the bottom perimeter. And the track count didn't improve by much - still just under 200.</p>

<p>Version 4 had the same basic layout as version 3 but I've learned to recognize a few signs of upcoming problems and could work to avoid them. The result had a further reduction in tracks, almost a 10% cut down to under 180. Plus I needed even fewer perimeter rescue paths.</p>

<p>The English language has the colloquialism "Paint yourself into a corner" and this is a very similar thing - it's very easy to route yourself into a situation with no way out. I wish I could condense the lessons I learned into a summary here, but so far it's just a lot of trial-and-error. Try something until I run into an obstacle, then try to figure out how to get out of this mess.</p>
<p>At this point the only words of wisdom I could offer is - dive in and try. It won't work, but you'll learn. Try and try again until you get good enough to get to a point where everything is connected, however inelegant it might be, and keep iterating to improve from there.</p>
