<p>When we were putting together code to calculate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometry">Ackermann steering angles</a> for <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/SGVHAK_Rover">SGVHAK rover</a>'s wheels, initial testing was done via Python command line using some fixed test values to match against results pre-calculated by hand. Once we built some confidence our math was on the right track, it was time to start testing against more varied inputs.</p>
<p>There was just one minor problem - at this point in rover development, our software is a tiny bit ahead of the hardware which means we can't test on hardware that <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/04/10/rover-frame-assembly/">hasn't yet been assembled</a>. Even if we could, it wouldn't be a great idea to jump from a small fixed set of test values to actual hardware. As an intermediate step, we created a bit of code to visualize results of <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/SGVHAK_Rover/blob/master/SGVHAK_Rover/roverchassis.py">roverchass.py calculations</a>: the "Chassis Configuration" screen will show what our control code <em>thinks</em> all six wheels should be doing. (This shows the <em>intent</em>, which is different from hardware telemetry of what's <em>actually</em> happening.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16113" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sgvhak-rover-chassis-config.png" alt="SGVHAK Rover Chassis Config" width="953" height="387"></p>
<p>Each of the six wheels got its own blue box, laid out roughly analogous to their physical position on the rover chassis. Originally wheel steering &amp; speed was displayed as text: number of degrees a wheel should be steered, and a second number reflecting the intended velocity for each wheel. This was accurate information but it took some effort to interpret. To make this information easier to understand, numerical text was <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/SGVHAK_Rover/commit/96ffe9e8717da51379d6206bc31c3aa568545f25#diff-ba3b54985cb721692466de9f2eb8c9cc">changed to a visual representation</a>.</p>
<p>By using HTML's <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, we could draw some simple graphics. Each wheel is represented by a black rectangular outline. A wheel's steering angle is now represented by tilting its rectangle to that angle. Inside a wheel's rectangle is a green fill representing desired velocity. When a wheel is supposed to be stopped, there is no green fill and its black rectangle is empty. When a wheel is supposed to be rolling forward, green rectangle fills from the middle upwards. Faster velocity is represented by more green in the upper half. For a wheel that should be rolling backwards, green fills downwards instead.</p>
<p>This visualization of roverchassis.py calculation results were far easier for humans to understand. This made it very quick to validate that roverchassis is behaving roughly correctly. There's a place for precise engineering calculations, but there's also place for a quick glance to check "yeah, that looks about right."</p>
