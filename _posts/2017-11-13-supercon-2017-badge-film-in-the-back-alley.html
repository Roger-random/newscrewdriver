<p>My Superconference 2017 camera badge project concludes with the 1-minute short "In the Back Alley of Spercon." I entered it into the short film festival and was ecstatic to have been selected as the winning film!</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7siOw5ezxM</p>
<p>I recorded a bunch of footage during the day on Saturday, but once the sun went down the camera could no longer record usable footage. So I switched efforts to putting together a presentation of what I've recorded. Since the camera badge has no audio capabilities - no microphone nor speaker - it was going to be a silent film by necessity. I followed precedence for silent films, using the text capabilities of the camera badge app framework to put up static text which give context to the moving pictures.</p>
<p>I started with the ambition of writing a short film editing app on the phone, and quickly decided that would take more time than I had. I switched to hard-coding the sequence of text and videos into <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/cambadge/blob/master/avitrim.c">a single app</a> that I could run on the camera badge. You can still see my original intent in the filename "avitrim."</p>
<p>Once running, I had something I could show to other people. Friendly curious people had asked about my project in progress Friday and Saturday, and now I could press "Go" to show them the results. Unfortunately that wouldn't work for the film festival, where they intend to put it up on the big screen. I talked to Hackaday Mike and he suggested I record the badge app in action and put it up on YouTube.</p>
<p>I tried a few different cameras and they all exhibited problems trying to record the footage playing on the OLED screen. Blooming, flickering, and loss of color saturation to various degrees that I struggle to correct with camera settings. The least-bad version came from my cell phone's camera so that's the one I uploaded to YouTube.</p>
<p>Playing the YouTube clip on my TV indicated the video was good enough, but the audio was not. I held my breath during the recording so people wouldn't have to hear my breathing, but the microphone picked up other background sounds. To cover up this annoyance, I went to the YouTube royalty-free music library and picked out a music clip that's roughly a minute long. It's not exactly my favorite song but it's far better than random background noises.</p>
<p>(The project described in this post is <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/28129-panning-time-lapse-with-supercon-2017-cambadge">documented on Hackaday.io</a> and the source code is <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/cambadge">publicly available on Github</a>.)</p>
