<p>I know I haven't uncovered all of the paper handling mechanisms of this Canon Pixma MX340 I'm taking apart, but I'm already impressed with the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/23/canon-pixma-mx340-paper-path/">partial overview I've got so far</a>. Right now my focus is tracing those paper feed rollers back to the motor gearbox driving them.</p>

<p>There are two paper feed rollers visible here, one before and one after the printing area. Each of those roller shafts are attached to a large white gear. A smaller intermediate gear sits between them to drive both. Earlier I had thought the motor must be behind that center gear, but it turned out the motor was actually a little lower.</p>

<p>The motor output shaft has a small black plastic gear, almost blending into the shadows. I traced only two wires leading into this area, implying it's a brushed DC motor down there. Some of the older inkjet printers I took apart earlier <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/07/22/learning-how-to-use-pololu-stepper-driver-modules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used stepper motors</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-loop_controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-loop control</a>. In this printer, precise control is accomplished with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-loop_controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed-loop control system</a>: the gear on the left has an encoder wheel and a sensor reading its motion providing feedback.</p>

<p>Flipping my camera lens to "super macro" mode, I got this close-up picture of the encoder ring. It is series of very fine evenly spaced radial lines, consistent with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_encoder">incremental encoder</a>. I see four wires leading to the sensor, consistent with things I expect to see: power, ground, A, and B. I'll hook them up to my oscilloscope later to verify this deduction.</p>

<p>This motor drives a lot more than the two paper feed rollers immediately adjacent to the print area. One of the paper feed rollers transmit its power all the way across the printer to a gearbox behind the print head parking area. It's likely involved in feeding paper from the input tray, and others I look forward to deciphering later. Right now, though, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/25/canon-pixma-mx340-paper-output-tray-door/">another interesting feature of this printer</a> is immediately adjacent and accessible.</p>
