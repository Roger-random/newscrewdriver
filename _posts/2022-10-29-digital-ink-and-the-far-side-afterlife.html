<p>A few weeks ago I picked up a graphical drawing display to play with. I am confident in my skills with software and knowledge of electronics, but I was also fully aware none of that would help me actually draw. That will take dedication and practice, which <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/10/13/up-and-running-on-monoprice-creator-22/">I am still working on</a>. Very different from myself are those who come at this from the other side: they have the artistic skills, but maybe not in the context of digital art. Earlier I mentioned <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3ynx9wG" target="_blank"><em>The Line King </em>documentary</a> (*) showed Al Hirschfeld playing with a digital tablet climbing the rather steep learning curve to transfer his decades of art skills to digital tools. I just learned of another example: Gary Larson.</p>

<p>Like Al Hirschfeld, Gar Larson is an artist I admired but in an entirely different context. Larson is the author of <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Far_Side" target="_blank">The Far Side</a></em>, a comic that was published in newspapers via syndication. If you don't already know <em>The Far Side</em> it can be hard to explain, but words like strange, weird, bizarre, and surreal would be appropriate. I've bought several Far Side compilations, my favorite being <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3NhwfIg" target="_blank">The PreHistory of The Far Side </a></em>(*) which included behind-the-scenes stories from Gary Larson to go with selected work.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>With that background, I was obviously delighted to find that the official Far Side website has a "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thefarside.com/new-stuff" target="_blank">New Stuff</a>" section, headlined by a story from Larson about new digital tools. After retirement, Larson would still drag out his old tools every year to draw a Christmas card. A routine that has apparently been an ordeal dealing with dried ink on infrequently used pen. One year instead of struggling with cleaning a clogged pen, Larson bought a digital drawing tablet and rediscovered the joy of artistic creation. I loved hearing that story and even though only a few comics have been published under that "New Stuff" section, I'm very happy that an artist I admired has found joy in art again.</p>

<p>As for myself, I'm having fun with my graphical drawing display. The novelty has not yet worn off, but neither have I produced any masterpieces. The future of my path is still unknown.</p>
