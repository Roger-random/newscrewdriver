<p>An exhibits-only pass holder like myself is barred from most of the interesting presentations and talks. However, we are thrown a bone in the form of the SIGGRAPH Exhibitor Sessions. I had expected these to be glorified sales pitches for the companies that exhibit at the convention, but they exceeded my expectations and turned out to be informative, educational, entertaining, and often combinations thereof.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-9352 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/opensubdiv.jpg" alt="OpenSubdiv" width="333" height="63">Pixar had a few sessions centering around their open-source efforts. I realized I might have been out of my depth when the <a href="http://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/intro.html">OpenSubdiv </a>talk dove straight into adoption success and future road map of the product. They didn't bother explaining <em>what it was</em> to ignorant people like myself - I guess if I didn't know, I didn't belong at that session.</p>
<p>Several software vendors offered sessions for their customers to talk about their work. Such sessions accomplish multiple objectives at once: The software product is seen in action as a production tool, the customer of the product advertise their service, and we learn a little of the nuts-and-bolts behind the scenes. I attended one such talk that broke down some of the work behind the animated household items of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2771200"><em>Beauty and the Beast</em> (2017)</a>, and a different session (by a different vendor) talked about Rocket and Baby Groot in <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3896198">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a></em>.</p>
<p>Much of the technical details went over my head. I wish I was a little more conversant on these topics, but I did catch a few things here and there and jotted down a few items to look up when I got home. One example was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alembic_(computer_graphics)">Alembic </a>interchange format used by these effects houses to collaborate on a film. Since each shop has different software tools and different ways of working with them, an open data interchange format like Alembic is essential for the ecosystem to function.</p>
