<p>I experimented with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/06/faux-vfd-experiment-on-codepen/">building a faux VFD effect</a> on modern screens. Just a quick prototype without a lot of polish. Certainly not nearly as much as some other projects out there putting a retro look on modern screens. One of those I've been impressed with is <code><a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term">cool-retro-term</a></code>. (Mentioned as almost an aside in this <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/03/31/a-weather-station-fit-for-a-pdp-11/">Hackaday article about a mini PDP-11 project</a>.) I installed it on my Ubuntu machine and was very amused to see a window pop up looking like an old school amber CRT computer monitor.</p>

<p>The amber color looks perfect, and the text received a coordinate transform to make the text area look like a curved surface. Not visible in a screenshot are bits of randomness added to the coordinate transform emulating the fact CRT pixels aren't as precisely located as LCD pixels. There is also a slight visual flicker effect simulating CRT vertical refresh.</p>

<p>The detail I found most impressive is the fact effects aren't limited to the "glass" area: there is even a slight reflection of text on the "bezel" area!</p>

<p>So how was all this done? Poking around the GitHub repository I think this was written using <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/framework">Qt native UI framework</a>. Qt was something I had ambition to learn, but I've put more time into learning web development because of all the free online resources out there. I see a lot of files with the <code>*.qml</code> extension, indicating this is a newer way to create Qt interfaces: QML markup versus API calls from code. Looking around for something that looks like the core of emulating imperfect CRTs, the most promising candidate for a starting point is the file <a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term/blob/master/app/qml/ShaderTerminal.qml"><code>ShaderTerminal.qml</code></a>. I see mentions of CRT visual attributes like static noise, curvature, flickering, and more.</p>

<p>It should be possible to make an online browser version of this effect. If the vertex shaders in <code>cool-retro-term</code> are too complex for WebGL, it should be possible to port them to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/17/notes-on-google-i-o-2023-advanced-web-browser-capabilities/">WebGPU</a>. Turning that theory into practice would require me to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/20/notes-on-your-first-webgpu-app-code-lab/">actually get proficient with WebGPU</a>, and learn enough Qt to understand all the nuts and bolts of how <code>cool-retro-term</code> works so I can translate them. Given my to-do list of project ideas, this is unlikely to rise to the top unless some other motivation surfaces.</p>
