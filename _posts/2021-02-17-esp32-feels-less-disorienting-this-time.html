<p>Seeing all the interesting projects built with an ESP32 has made me interested in learning more about the popular platform, but it wouldn't be real until I dedicate the time and focus to build some projects of my own. My micro Sawppy project might be the motivation I needed to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/02/16/thoughts-on-micro-sawppy-brain/">get down to business</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Querying in this blog's history, I was embarrassed to realize that it's been over two years since <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/11/23/the-wide-world-of-esp32/" target="_blank">I first thought I would build something with an ESP32</a>. My first exposure to the fire hose of information online was overwhelming. But I returned occasionally to pick off little bite-sized pieces to digest. Reading documentation on some specific aspect on the ESP32 at a time, usually in response to seeing someone's project making cool use of that particular aspect. I wanted to see how it was done!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>During this incremental learning, I picked up on the fact something is coordinating the works to keep all the plates up in the air. Eventually learning that the default ESP32 runtime environment includes a minimalist operating system for embedded hardware: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.freertos.org/" target="_blank">FreeRTOS</a>. Which was a world onto itself! There is <a href="https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/RTOS_book.html">a tutorial e-Book</a> to help get people up to speed but again, it is a lot of information that I had to digest a little bit at a time. I'll write more about FreeRTOS later.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And though I hadn't reached the point of writing my own ESP32 code, I did start getting a bit of hands-on experience working with an ESP32 developer board. Which was more full featured than the minimalist mesh networking Supercon hack that was my first introduction to the hardware. Even though I was only running other people's code (like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/08/16/evaluate-grbl-for-xy-stage/" target="_blank">Bart Dring's ESP32 Grbl port</a>) and not my own code, it was valuable familiarization of the ESP32 landscape.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All of these individual pieces built up a comfort level that was absent from my first time facing the avalanche of information available for ESP32 over two years ago. Now I can look at the page like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://esp32.net/" target="_blank">ESP32.net</a> and have a much better understanding why things are organized the way they were, and which pieces of information are relevant to others. This knowledge map is important as I do some basic due diligence to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/02/19/notes-on-esp32-pwm-peripherals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see if it's feasible to build a micro Sawppy brain from an ESP32</a>. Before I get any further on my little rovers, though, there's <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/02/18/mars-2020-perseverance-surface-operations-begin/">a big event for a big rover</a>.</p>
