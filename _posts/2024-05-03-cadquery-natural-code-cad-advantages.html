<p>I found some <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/05/02/cadquery-extrude-until-could-prove-powerful/">novel features like "extrude until"</a> while reading through "<a href="https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">Examples</a>" section of CadQuery documentation. The final example on that page (as of this writing) was for <a href="https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#cycloidal-gear">a cycloidal gear</a> and it reminded me of a big reason why I'm looking into code CAD to begin with: I can do things in code! Cycloidal gear profile can get a bit involved to draw with standard 2D sketching tools, and 2D sketches require work to make them adjustable to suit different parameters. But as a code CAD platform, CadQuery can consume gear profile defined with Python math functions. And since it's a Python function, it takes very little extra work to have it recompute a different profile based on function parameters.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>But while a cycloidal gear looks cool, it's not what I would want to design and 3D print. Well, I tend to avoid printing gears entirely because 3D printers don't have the precision necessary for good gears, but when it is unavoidable, I prefer to use standard mechanical engineering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute_gear">involute gears</a>. As they are quite standard, I was confident someone has already written CadQuery code to generate involute gears and I found not one but two examples in the <a href="https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery-contrib">CadQuery contributions repository</a>.</p>

<p>Easy publication of small functional snippets like this is another advantage of code CAD: it fits right into source code control and publishing infrastructure. A bit of Python file is a lot more easily maintained and ensure availability compared to FreeCAD's approach of publishing <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/FCGear_InvoluteGear">an entire workbench called FCGear</a>.</p>

<p>While I love seeing the concept of user-contributed code CAD repository, the actual execution may not be panning out. Code contribution frequency to <code>cadquery-contrib</code> isn't as high as what I would interpret as a popular and vibrant user community. What's going on? Maybe this specific repository fell out of favor for some reason with the user community, and they're sharing via some other mechanism I haven't discovered. Or maybe nobody is using CadQuery and the project is on a path of a slow decline into irrelevance. I hope it is the former and not the latter, but even then it wouldn't be the first time I put effort into a platform that faded away. I shouldn't let that fear discourage me as I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/05/04/cadquery-selector-full-capability-via-code/">climb CadQuery's learning curve</a>.</p>
