<p>When I tear down some retired electronic device, I try to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/04/02/esphome-remote-receiver-test-simplistic-shooting-game/">salvage what I know I could reuse</a> and that usually includes the power supply. A few of these salvaged power supplies have already found use, but sometimes I'm hindered by the fact I saved only the power supply and not its corresponding power socket. Sometimes I can replace the connector, but sometimes not. As a result, I've resolved to put more effort into saving the matching socket as well.</p>

<p>Which brings me to this Roku Premiere 4620X ("Cooper") that was given to me for teardown after it was retired. I tried to unsolder its power socket, but I quickly realized I was in trouble. When I put my soldering iron tip on the soldered point and... absolutely nothing happened. Looking at the circuit board I can see there's a lot of copper tied to ground, which four of five pins on this power socket is attached to. That's a lot of heat dissipation capacity fighting against my iron's efforts to melt solder.</p>

<p>I think a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/29/hot-air-station-amateur-hour/" target="_blank">hot air rework station</a> might be able to help here, but I don't have one and my lack of skill means there is a high risk of softening the black plastic as I blast hot air. If I distort the plastic to a point where the power plug could no longer fit, that would defeat the purpose. This concern also definitely ruled out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/05/cheap-seats-at-the-hot-air-gun-show/" target="_blank">my paint-stripping hot air gun</a>.</p>

<p>I think the best tool for this job is a hot plate designed for installing surface-mount electronics components. Their hot metal surface area could in theory do this work at a lower temperature than blowing hot air. I wouldn't necessarily need a big one, either. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4948" target="_blank">tiny little one</a> would be enough to do this job.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But I don't have any of those tools, so I fell back to plan of last resort I call "mechanical separation". That is my fancy way of saying I whipped out a saw and cut the circuit board around the socket.</p>

<p>Sometime in the future, when I decide I want to reuse this power supply and its matching power socket, I hope to have better tools for the job of separating the socket from its (now much reduced) circuit board.</p>
