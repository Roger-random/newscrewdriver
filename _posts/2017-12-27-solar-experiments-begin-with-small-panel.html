<p>Solar power can be a part of everyday life in many different ways, from tiny solar-powered calculators to a home rooftop solar power system. There is great potential for interesting solar power projects. But before that: some investigation to get orientated.</p>
<p>The low-power capability of the 8-bit PIC micro controller might make an interesting pairing with calculator-sized solar panels, but let's not overly constrain ourselves on power budget until we are comfortable dealing with it. Similarly, a home rooftop solar system is well into the realm of power that can kill, and thus a bad idea for beginner experimentation.</p>
<p>Let's learn with cheap things first by starting with a small solar panel from Harbor Freight. <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/15-watt-solar-battery-charger-62449.html">Item #62449</a> is designed to be placed in a parked car to keep its battery topped off with solar power. With the coupons typical of Harbor Freight, it should be obtainable for less than $10.</p>
<p>The panel is advertised to supply power to a car battery. So our first quick-and-easy experiment is to wire it up to an accessory meant for car power: an USB charger designed to plug into the lighter socket.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15667" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/small-solar.jpg" alt="Small solar" width="1024" height="593"></p>
<p>This particular USB charger has a blue LED to indicate power. When the solar panel is placed in direct sunlight, the blue LED illuminates. Unfortunately it doesn't do much beyond that - if a USB peripheral is plugged in to charge, the LED goes dark and there is no sign of charging taking place.</p>
<p>Well, we've tried the easy thing first. Now we start poking around to better understand what we're dealing with.</p>
