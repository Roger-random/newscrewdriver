<p>Two years ago I said goodbye to <a href="https://www.att.com/internet/">AT&amp;T internet</a> (formerly branded U-Verse) because it was slower yet cost more than the faster <a href="https://www.spectrum.com/internet.html">Charter Spectrum cable internet</a>'s introductory rate. As a longtime customer of <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/">Comcast Xfinity</a> in the Pacific Northwest, I knew the game of calling in every year to renew that "introductory" rate. So after my first year with Charter, I called and got on a different promotional rate that was a little higher but still enough of a discount from the full rate to make me stay.</p>
<p>Since then, Charter has completed its acquisition of Time Warner and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/charter-has-moved-millions-of-customers-to-new-and-often-higher-pricing/">stories started surfacing</a> about how they are aggressively raising their average revenue per customer. The prices went up and promotional discounts disappeared. This month I found out for myself. My promotional rate was expiring and the base cost is going up. I called in and talked to the normal customer service representative as well as the customer retention department. I was disappointed that no price discount was available even when I said I wanted to stop service. Well, they are indeed serious, and because I live in an area with some competition, I was not bluffing about leaving. So long, Charter!</p>
<p>Since I've been away from AT&amp;T for two years, the fine print implied I should qualify for their introductory rate again. But before I move from one mega-corporation to another, I had another option: <a href="https://gigglefiber.com/">Giggle Fiber</a>. The name is silly and it was easy to wonder whether they might be trying to riff off press on <a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/">Google Fiber</a>.  But as far as I can tell they are a legitimate internet service provider with a small local service area. Unlike most high-speed service providers, they don't even have their own Wikipedia page. They were only mentioned in passing as an entity that acquired the internet service assets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_Broadband">a different company</a>. Their business model seems to be fairly straightforward: to compete with the big guys, offer more speed for less money.</p>
<p>My home straddles a city line so I'm at the edge of their service area and it took some asking around to determine I was indeed eligible. Most of my research only found fluffy marketing pieces in local newspapers, which made me pause, but eventually I decided to support the small local business. The installation ran into a few issues and took longer than the scheduled time slot, but the installation staff were friendly and courteous and got their infrastructure problems resolved.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the numbers don't lie. Giggle Fiber is <strong><em>fast</em></strong>. Now I just have to see if the service is reliable as well.</p>
