<p>I have added WebUSB to my ever-growing to-learn list, hoping it would enable some really cool project ideas. As indicated by its name, I would need to know both web development and USB development before I can make them work together towards my goals. While I work my way through <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/08/16/potential-webusb-study-syllabus/">my self-directed USB study syllabus</a>, I will also spend some time reviewing web development.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm not a complete beginner with web development, but that world is broad and it evolves quickly. Every time I applied browser-based technology to a project idea, I find some of my knowledge out of date. <em>Plus </em>I have to learn something new in an area I haven't dealt with before. This is great! Approaching from a different direction every time helps me get a more well-rounded picture of the whole thing. This time I want revisit building web apps that present an user interface for a database.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>My motivation is twofold. One is directly related to my desire to use WebUSB. Since any WebUSB project will be dealing with data flowing in and out of an external source (the USB peripheral) I expect many JavaScript constructs to resemble those used to communicate data to and from an external database. The second is that I've wanted to get better at applying database technology. So I can use it when it is the right tool for the job instead of, say, abusing Microsoft Excel. "Excel is not a Database" is an ongoing joke in the computer world. People do it because starting an Excel spreadsheet is far easier than setting up a database. Excel is "good enough" at small scales, but spirals into chaos as data set grows. There's no shortage of horror stories ranging from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/formula-1-chief-appalled-to-find-team-using-excel-to-manage-20000-car-parts/">Formula 1 race car construction</a> to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54423988">losing important healthcare data.</a></p>

<p>I want to avoid such disasters myself, because I'm definitely guilty of abusing Excel for poorly-suited problems. Some novel hacks <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/01/06/canon-pixma-mx340-control-panel-lcd-screen-data-as-excel-background-fill/">turn out to be a delightful success</a>, others times I find I really needed an actual database. I want it in my toolbox. This is something of a "return to where it all began" because my first web technology lesson many years ago came from <em><a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">The Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a></em>. The main tutorial project was a web application interfacing with a database server. It's a pattern common enough that I've since learned of an acronym for it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete">CRUD apps</a>. And <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/08/18/many-options-for-create-read-update-delete-crud-web-applications/">there exist many ways</a> for me to build one of my own.</p>
