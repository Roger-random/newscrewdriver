<p>I don't remember exactly when and where I saw the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, but I do remember it was during its theatrical release and I was with a group of people who were aware of the state of the art in computer graphics. We were there to admire the digital dinosaurs in that movie, which represented a tremendous leap ahead. Over twenty-five years later, the film is still recognized as a landmark in visual effects history. Yes, more than half of the dinosaurs in the film are physical effects, but the digital dinosaurs stood out.</p>
<p>Given the enthusiasm in computer generated effects, it naturally followed that this crowd was also computer literate.Â I believe we all knew our way around a UNIX prompt, so this was a crowd that erupted into laughter when the infamous "<em>It's a UNIX system! I know this!</em>" line was spoken.</p>

<p>I was running jobs on a centralized machine via <code>telnet</code>. Graphics user interface on UNIX systems were rare on the machines I had worked with, never mind with animated three-dimensional graphics! I had assumed it was a bit of Hollywood window dressing, because admittedly text characters on a command line doesn't work on the silver screen as well.</p>
<p>Well, that was a bad assumption. Maybe not all UNIX systems have interfaces that show the user flying over a three dimension landscape of objects, but one did! I have just learned it was <a href="https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/9745/is-the-unix-operating-system-featured-in-jurassic-park-real">an actual user interface available for Silicon Graphics machines</a>. SGI logo is visible on the computer monitor, and their machines were a big part of rendering those digital dinosaurs we were drooling over. It made sense the production crew would be aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsn_(file_manager)">visually attractive (optional) component</a> for SGI's UNIX variant, IRIX.</p>
