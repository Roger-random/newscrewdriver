<p>I have <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/12/tapping-power-from-rx-8-navigation-hood/">electric power supply and other connections figured out</a> for putting a wireless CarPlay/Android Auto receiver in place of the factory navigation system display in my 2004 Mazda RX-8. Now I need to figure out how to keep everything physically in place. Normally I would turn to 3D printing to solve such problems, but this will be on top of a black car dashboard. I know for sure 3D printed PLA plastic parts <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/23/sawppy-the-rovers-pla-wheels-deformed-under-heat/">soften and deform under summer sun</a>, and that wasn't even inside a car. I think PETG could withstand such temperatures, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Uncertain of plastic durability, I turned to metal. This was the folded sheet metal tray <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/07/seagate-backup-hub-external-drive-8tb-srd0pv1-teardown/">from a Seagate external backup drive</a>. I cut out the four tabs that formerly held screws securing the 3.5" HDD in place.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These tabs were then used to hold the receiver in place, using original support posts and their screws. This is not a very precise mechanism. Because the tabs would shift slightly as I tightened the screws, it was hard to keep the receiver in exactly the right place to ensure the screen image is perfectly centered. After several attempts ended with a slightly off-center alignment, I decided "meh, close enough" and moved on.</p>

<p>The slight misalignment made me glad I decided against drilling a hole for the integrated microphone. I haven't used voice assistant features and I don't intend to start. And since I didn't drill a microphone hole, I don't have to worry about precisely aligning it, either.</p>

<p>Now I need to put the original display circuit board back in, without the display. The only reason it is still here is because it also handles retraction motor control and I wanted to preserve that capability. I first tried to fit the circuit board while it was still installed on its metal backing plate. I liked the extra structural rigidity, and I hoped the metal plate would act as shielding protecting the receiver from interference.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's not enough room. Top edge of the circuit board sticks out beyond where the lid would go. For everything to fit, I will have to go without that metal plate.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The receiver's own plastic enclosure should act as electrical insulation on the bottom. On top, I cut down a depleted Costco shop card to act as shield and insulation against the retraction servo assembly.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/t86mp5-mounting-14-in-car-test.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-38369"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A quick in-car test looks good enough to proceed: the retraction motor worked as long as I ensured <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/11/navigation-hood-actuator-electrical-test/">it stayed in operating range</a>, and the receiver boots up as expected.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/t86mp5-mounting-16-lcd-pcb-zip-tied-in-place.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-38370"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With that success, I buttoned everything down. The original LCD circuit board, now just a retraction motor control board, is then secured via zip-ties. Then everything was put back in the car for <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/14/integrated-test-failed-due-to-interference/">a full-up functional test</a>.</p>
