<p>I'm tearing apart <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/19/amazon-fire-sr043kl-teardown-begins/">an Amazon Fire tablet (SR043KL) with cracked front glass</a>, and knowing full well this low-budget device would not have been designed to be easily serviceable. After I popped off the back shell, I quickly ran into things held by adhesives of one type or another. My first focus is to see if I can free the mainboard.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The easiest item to release is the battery connector. Two screws held a reinforcement metal plate and, once those two screws were removed, the battery connector popped free easily. On the right side of the battery, I had to peel off some tape to reveal a fairly standard connector for these ubiquitous Kapton yellow flexible circuit boards. The rear facing camera connector easily popped free, but peeling it away from double-sided tape holding it in place took more effort. On the upper-right corner was an enigma. I would eventually learn this was the cable for the touch digitizer glass panel, but after I freed the small connector nothing came loose. The large yellow square was held <em>tight</em> and I didn't want to pry too hard in case it was soldered underneath to something. I left this for later.</p>

<p>After I removed every visible screw, the mainboard remained stubbornly in place. Poking and prodding all around, I eventually noticed these two plastic claws.</p>

<p>Once freed from these claws, I could flip the mainboard over, still connected by the black touch digitizer cable I had yet to remove.</p>

<p>From here we can see metal reinforcement for the USB port and audio jack, each held down by two screws on either side of the corresponding socket. I think the red rubbery part is a cap over the microphone, next to the front-facing camera module. Springy metal fingers make contact with parts on the chassis. From left to right they are: power button (only two out of three contacts are used), the volume up/down buttons (only three out of four contacts used) and the WiFi/Bluetooth antenna. (All three contacts used.)</p>

<p>I had hoped there would be something interesting to see on this side of the board, but no luck. The opposite side is mostly hidden under soldered-on metal shielding, I think I need a heat plate to remove them nicely. For the moment, components on the mainboard would have to remain a mystery. So I set it aside and started working on <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/21/amazon-fire-sr043kl-battery-and-digitizer-cable/">a stubborn battery</a>, accidentally severing the touch digitizer cable while doing so.</p>
