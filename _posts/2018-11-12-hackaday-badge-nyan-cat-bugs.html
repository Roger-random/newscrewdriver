<p>I had a great time at 2018 Hackaday Superconference and I think Nyan Cat was a success as part of the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/161859-2018-hackaday-superconference-badge">conference badge</a>. I'm happy with it, even though I found two minor problems with my Nyan Cat app during the weekend.</p>
<p>The first problem was that it does not tell the badge it is running, which is required to prevent automatic power-down. The auto-sleep feature was added after my code was merged into master, shortly before the badges started getting flashed <em>en masse</em>. I knew this power saving feature was going in but I was busy with badge production. So I didn't have the chance to add code to keep the badge from going to sleep while Nyan Cat is running. My life was filled with rows and rows of badges.</p>

<p>What this means is that Nyan Cat couldn't just keep running on a badge forever. The badge will go to sleep and need to be awakened for animation to resume.</p>
<p>Somewhat related to the above, there's a problem with timer synchronization upon wake. It appears that when the badge is asleep, the main timer still advances at some rate. I believe this is a side effect of <code>loop_badge()</code> in <a href="https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/2018-Supercon-Badge/blob/master/firmware/badge-supercon18.X/src/badge.c">badge.c</a>. Called by timer #5 every 15 milliseconds to check the status of the power button. During this check, the main system timer (running on timer #1) clicks upwards even though the rest of the badge is asleep.</p>
<p>What this means is that, if the badge is running Nyan Cat when it goes into low power mode, the timer will advance even though the animation &amp; music does not. As a result, when the badge wakes up, the loops in charge of animation and timing will frantically try to catch up. It only takes a second or two to get back in sync, but in that brief moment we get a comically distorted kitty running and singing at warp speed.</p>
<p>This second problem can be reproduced by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Nyan Cat with 'nya' to see and hear dancing singing pop tart cat.</li>
<li>Push the power button to put the badge in low power mode.</li>
<li>Wait about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Push the button again to wake up the badge.</li>
<li>See and hear cat in hyperdrive for a few seconds before slowing down to normal speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>I might go back and fix these bugs in the future, but they're not horrendous embarrassments (and Nyan Cat in hyperdrive is pretty hilarious) so I'm content to leave them as-is for now.</p>
