<p>It was reassuring to learn that Google Chrome team is <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/18/notes-on-google-i-o-2023-browser-debugging/">continuing to invest in debugging tools</a> for web developers, but I need to practicing writing more web apps before I have anything to debug. My final set of Google I/O presentations focus on Angular framework, which I've been learning about and intend to use for future projects.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://io.google/2023/program/ebab5344-0315-44d2-8923-4571c537e3bb/">What's new in Angular</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The biggest news for Google I/O 2023 is the release of Angular 16, and the rundown included a mixture of features I understood and features I did not. One of the latter is "Angular Standalone" which I knew was introduced in an early state in Angular 15. I had mentally filed it away as an advanced feature I could postpone to later, but these presenters said it was intended to reduce Angular learning curve. Oh yeah? Maybe I shouldn't have shelved it. I should take a closer look.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>New to Angular 16 is "<a href="http://goo.gle/angular-signals">Angular Signals</a>". I saw mentions of this <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/12/notes-on-learn-rxjs/">when I was learning RxJS</a>, but all I saw at the time were excitement from reactive programming proponents. Listening to its overview in this presentation, I quickly realized this was Angular catching up to what Vue.js had with its reactive data system. For more details, we were pointed to another session...</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://io.google/2023/program/0759219f-1f7f-4cc1-832c-50b98ea2b6d4/">Rethinking reactivity with Signals</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This session covered Angular Signals in more detail. Conceptually, I understood an Angular signal is equivalent to fields in Vue <code>data()</code>. An Angular "computed" is a counterpart to members of Vue's <code>computed</code>, changing in response to signal changes. And finally, Angular's "effect" is analogous to Vue's <code>watch</code>, executing code in response to signal changes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While concepts may be similar, Angular's implementation have some significant differences. For example, Angular is all-in on TypeScript and incorporating type information in Angular Signals didn't feel like a hacked-on afterthought like it did for Vue data. As a fan of TypeScript, I found this very encouraging.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After concepts of Angular Signal were introduced and explained, this presentation follows up the theory with some hands-on practice. This presentation is a companion to the <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/angular-signals">code lab on Angular signals</a>, building <a href="https://io-signals.netlify.app/">a sample cipher game</a>. I want to go through that code lab myself and learn the primary lesson, and I expect I can learn even more from that exercise beyond the main lesson of Angular signals. But first, I'm curious to learn <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/20/notes-on-your-first-webgpu-app-code-lab/">what GPU programming looks like with WebGPU</a>.</p>
