<!-- wp:paragraph --><html><body></p>
<p>Freshly encouraged by <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/18/packing-bubble-squish-test-data/">data gathering via Node-RED with serial communications</a>, I investigated getting another set of data points. In the packing bubble squish experiment I could see pressure data from the load cell, which showed me the bubble relaxing (and thus reducing pressure) over time. What I could not see was the physical displacement corresponding to that reduction in pressure. I assume the Z-axis carriage did not move, so the reduction likely took the form of flex in the acrylic plate. How might I measure that kind of data for future experiments?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An answer could be found from the field of machining, indicators are used to measure linear displacement precisely. How precise? In the world of machining, I can have any precision I want, but precision costs money. How precise do I want to afford for this project? I started by looking at cheap electronic indicators like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.harborfreight.com/saemetric-digital-indicator-63613.html" target="_blank">Harbor Freight item #63613</a>. ($30) But while the manual hinted at a data output port, there's no further information about it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I started looking further and further up the food chain and, while I could find indicators with digital output, they have the similar problem of either a poorly documented or proprietary undisclosed format. Eventually I passed the $100 mark and I started getting discouraged. I was not willing to spend that kind of money on an instrument made by a company I have not known for quality precision.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And that's when a brand I <strong><em>have </em></strong>known for quality precision popped up in my search: Mitutoyo. I know that name well from my machining course and other precision contexts, but they have all been very expensive at several hundred dollars and up. I didn't know they made a low-end model (with corresponding lower precision) available at around $150. Certainly many times more than the Harbor Freight item, but it is a name I trust to be precise, and popular enough that details of their data port (called SPC or Statistical Process Control port) would be documented somewhere.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For extra reassurance I decided to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mcmaster.com/20835A72/" target="_blank">pay a little extra to buy from known vendor McMaster-Carr</a>, and when it arrived I got my first surprise: the data port interface instructions were in the box! This was a great good start to a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/22/arduino-interface-for-mitutoyo-spc-data-port/">successful project connecting Mitutoyo SPC data port</a>.</p>
