<p>When I decided to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/04/polarizing-filter-photography-is-magic/">play with polarized light photography</a>, I knew I would need a source for polarized light in addition to buying a polarizer filter for my camera. And I had just the thing: an old and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/17/strange-failure-of-monoprice-monitor-10734/" target="_blank">strangely malfunctioning Monoprice monitor (10734)</a> that has been converted to become a lighting panel for diffuse white light by feeding it a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/08/17/full-screen-white-vga-signal-with-bitluni-esp32-library/" target="_blank">pure white VGA video signal</a>. I didn't originally have polarization in mind when I started that project, but I knew <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display" target="_blank">LCD displays</a> work via light polarization. As soon as I started thinking about a polarized light source, it was an obvious fit. This was once an expensive and capable computer monitor and I hoped I could put it to work again.</p>

<p>Using a monitor as a light panel means installing the monitor facing downwards. This isn't something the stock monitor stand could handle, neither could most aftermarket monitor mounting solutions. I found a few that can possibly work and handle the weight (it's a pretty heavy monitor) but they cost more than I wanted to spend for an experiment. So I'm going to mount it to the bottom of an old beat up <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/lack-coffee-table-black-brown-40104294/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IKEA Lack coffee table</a>.</p>

<p>Since LACK furniture is mostly hollow, I didn't expect to be able to handle the weight concentrated on a few bolt heads. Fortunately, the stock monitor stand has a metal plate I could use to spread the weight across a larger area.</p>

<p>The plate was useful as a drilling template as well. I drilled four holes for M4 x 60mm hex bolts then mounted the plate on the table top.</p>

<p>I then threaded those four bolts into the monitor's mounting holes, making for a secure fit. I lifted this coffee table over my workbench, now it is illuminated by a 30" polarized light panel! I'm glad I didn't spend too much money on a fancy stand for this experiment, because <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/06/problems-with-monoprice-monitor-10734-as-workbench-light/">a few problems quickly became apparent</a>.</p>
