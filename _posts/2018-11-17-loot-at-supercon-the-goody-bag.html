<p>When I checked in to Supercon Saturday morning, I was given the items given to every Supercon attendee. A T-shirt, of course. A magazine (pamphlet? flyer?) titled <em>Supplyframe RealTalk Electronics</em>. A small water bottle, and a reusable tote bag filled with stuff.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17220" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/supercon2018-goodie-bag.jpg" alt="Supercon2018 Goodie Bag" width="1024" height="747"></p>
<p>In the background of this picture is the tote bag. All the stickers in the bag were laid out to the lower left: two Tindie stickers and many more Hackaday stickers of all types. On the top is a Hackaday postcard. All fun stuff, but what excites Supercon attendees are the electronics.</p>
<p>The orange item in the upper left is the enigmatic Supplyframe cube. A 3D realization of their company logo, it has electronics inside for a purpose mysterious to Supercon attendees (at least at first.)</p>
<p>Next to the cube, sitting on top of its antistatic bag and nearly invisible due to its size, is a <a href="https://tomu.im">Tomu</a>. A complete ARM powered computer on a circuit board the size of a USB plug, it is remarkable here because it was still in development at last year's Supercon. At the time its creator had solved most hardware issues and was recruiting people to help write the supporting software. I heard the recruiting pitch but sadly my programming skills were not aligned with the project's needs. It's great to see that others have pitched in and made Tomu a reality.</p>
<p>Next to Tomu is a LED circuit board in the shape of Hackaday's Jolly Wrencher logo alongside a Tindie LED badge of similar function. Many attendees soldered these up through the weekend for a little bright wear.</p>
<p>Below the Tindie badge is a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14130">Sparkfun Roshamglo</a> board. I read the product description saying it was an electronic way to play rock-paper-scissors over infrared signals, but I knew that couldn't be the whole story because there's obviously a USB connector at the end and you don't need that for a silly little game. And further reading confirmed the rock-paper-scissors was only the default firmware - users can use the Arduino IDE to <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/roshamglo-hookup-guide">program the onboard ATTiny84 chip</a> to do something else. This might be a fun exploration.</p>
<p>And last but not least, in the lower right peering back at the camera is an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3900">Adafruit Hallowing</a>. It is shown assembled here because I couldn't wait to take a picture before putting it together. More on this nifty little board shortly.</p>
