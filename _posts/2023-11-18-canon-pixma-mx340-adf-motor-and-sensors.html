<p>I disassembled the control panel for this Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/17/canon-pixma-mx340-control-panel/">took a quick look from a mechanical perspective</a>. I'll return later for an electronics examination but right now I wanted to dig into the rest of the scanning/copying automatic document feeder (ADF). I got a taste of what's involved in an ADF from a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/16/canon-pixma-mx340-adf-lid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clever lid mechanism</a>, now it's time to see the rest of it.</p>

<p>The control panel had to be disassembled first because it uncovered the fasteners and latches I needed to release before I could remove this back cover.</p>

<p>Then I could see the ADF motor and gearbox assembly, including the gear that drove the ADF lid paper feed rollers. Judging by the presence of four wires going into this motor, I believe this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor#Bipolar_motors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bipolar stepper motor</a>.</p>

<p>Removing the bottom of the ADF paper feed tray allowed visibility into the core of this mechanism. In addition to paper handling rollers, I see a pair of photo interrupter sensors.</p>

<p>A plastic paddle attached to the bottom of the ADF paper feed tray slots into a sensor, visible towards the top of this picture. It detects when a document has been placed in the ADF. The sensor at the bottom of this picture still has its matching paddle in the slot, it detects whether a sheet of paper has been properly fed into the roller assembly.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the motor gearbox, I saw a beefy ground wire attached to foil tape.</p>

<p>This foil tape led into the middle of the ADF assembly...</p>

<p>... and out the bottom where it hovered over the entire width of the output tray. I believe this intends to dissipate any static electricity built up after the sheet of paper passes through the document scanner. The more interesting question is: was this always part of the design? Or was this added after testing uncovered problems with static electricity buildup? Foil tape is simple and effective for conducting low current, a good fit for managing static electricity buildup. But if static electric dissipation was the goal, I would have expected some stamped sheet metal integrated into this plastic structure. Foil tape felt like it might have been a hack. Which is fine, if it was. Canon engineers are only human after all and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/19/canon-pixma-mx340-adf-hinge/">this machine already has more than enough intricate designs to facinate me</a>.</p>
