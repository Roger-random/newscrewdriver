<p>After I finished <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/04/start-simple-with-low-cost-load-cell/">wiring the strain gauge array for a load cell</a>, I pulled the bundled circuit board out of its anti static bag. According to the product listing, this is built around a HX711 amplifier and analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. All that information I read earlier about putting excitation voltages into a Wheatstone bridge to interpret small changes in strain gauge resistance? All that magic is done inside this chip.</p>

<p>The bundle included some classic 0.1" pitch pins to solder to the circuit board, but I thought I had a better idea. I pulled out my JST-XH connector kit and used the six-position wire-to-board unit for my strain gauge array connection. JST-XH is polarized to help ensure I don't plug it in backwards. However, it is bigger than plain unadorned headers so it didn't fit with the surface mount components already on the board, requiring that I mount it to the flat backside instead.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I didn't perform the same JST-XH replacement for the digital data connection, because I wanted the flexibility to use jumper wires to connect this board to something I can use to read data from a HX711. Looking around for software libraries online, I <a href="https://github.com/bogde/HX711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found a HX711 library for Arduino</a> so I pulled out my prototyping breadboard with an Arduino Nano already on board. This is as good of a starting point as any.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Four jumper wires were needed: power, ground, data, and clock. The hardware is ready to go, so I switched gears to software and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/06/hx711-interface-library-as-introduction-to-platformio/">today's little plot twist of PlatformIO</a>.</p>
