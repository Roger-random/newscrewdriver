<p>The control panel of a Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet has only one significant microchip. It is marked NEC K13988 and I've traced through <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/12/22/canon-pixma-mx340-control-panel-ic-pinout-nec-k13988/">how it is connected to the rest of the circuit board</a>. Among these connections are two communication channels. One to the main board, and one to the LCD screen. I decided to look at main board communication first, wiring up those three pins to see how it looks under <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/08/24/finally-bought-a-real-oscilloscope/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my Siglent oscilloscope</a>. Since they were pins 1-3 on the circuit board connector, it was easiest to wire them up to channels 1-3 on the oscilloscope.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I saw a little bit of activity when I plugged in the printer, before I turned it on. Pin 2 came up to about 2.5V DC, and pin 1 came up just a little higher for 300ms before dropping back. About one second later, pin 1 came up to 3.3V, followed a few tens of milliseconds later by pins 2 and 3 together. A few tens of milliseconds after that, pin 3 dropped to ground and pin 2 dropped to 2.5V at around the same time. Then pin 1 dropped to ground, and all three lines stayed that way (pin 1+3 ground, pin 2 at 2.5V DC) for the printer standby state.</p>

<p>When I pressed the power button to turn on the printer, there was a flurry of activity I don't understand yet, but it quickly settled to this state:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/canon-pixma-mx340-control-board-on-with-no-activity-1ms.png?w=826" alt="" class="wp-image-41192"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is what it looks like when the printer is on with data on the LCD screen, but nothing else happening. Pins 1 and 3 stay at 3.3V DC with no activity. Pin 2 (magenta line) sends something at regular intervals. A little over 9ms between pulses, or at the oscilloscope measured rate at 108.439Hz.</p>

<p>Zooming in on the pin 2 state, it looks like it dips to ground for about 33us.</p>

<p>Pressing a button triggers a change on pin 2 activity. For this exploration I tried the four buttons under the LCD screen, starting with the above trace representing the back button.</p>

<p>And pressing OK.</p>

<p>These snapshots make pin 2 look like a digital serial communication data stream describing user input to the main board. It's a short enough burst I can probably decode the values by hand [UPDATE: I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/12/26/canon-pixma-mx340-control-panel-communication-appears-to-be-serial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decoded them by hand</a>.] but right now I want to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/12/24/canon-pixma-mx340-control-panel-lcd-updates-under-oscilloscope/">look at other pins first</a>.</p>
