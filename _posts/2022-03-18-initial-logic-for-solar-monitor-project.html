<!-- wp:paragraph --><html><body></p>
<p>I think I've got the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/03/17/two-problems-controlling-buck-converter/">hardware portions of my solar power monitor sensor node figured out</a>, so I can write the first version of corresponding software logic. I have set out the following requirements:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Over-discharge protection</strong>: If battery voltage drops below a threshold, put the system to sleep to protect the battery.</li>
<li>
<strong>Low solar output</strong>: When the solar panel isn't generating any power, put the system to sleep.</li>
<li>
<strong>Battery charging start</strong>: when panel power generation rises above a certain level for the first time that day, start charging the repurposed USB power bank battery.</li>
<li>
<strong>Battery charging pause</strong>: If cloud cover causes a dip in solar power, pause charging.</li>
<li>
<strong>Battery charging stop</strong>: Once battery cell voltage rises to a certain level, stop charging.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sleep override</strong>: local hardware method to prevent deep sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ESPHome documentation for deep sleep described one way to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://esphome.io/components/deep_sleep.html#deep-sleep-prevent-action" target="_blank">prevent sleep using MQTT</a>, keeping a node awake to receive firmware updates. But I wanted something even lower level hence the jumper and it became useful when I implemented the "low solar output, go to sleep" logic. Apparently INA219 component's first power value always return zero. Which meant as soon as it booted up, that initial zero reading puts the node immediately back to sleep before it would even get on the network. (Never mind checking MQTT!) The solution is to switch from sampling values once a minute to sampling once a second, and make decisions based on average over a minute.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A different approach would be to go to sleep based on sun's position in the sky, which can be queried and used in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://esphome.io/components/sun.html?highlight=sun" target="_blank">Sun component</a>. However, I expect this component has dependency on network connection (it needs to know the time, for starters) and would not be reliable if the network goes down. It also doesn't know if the sun is obscured by clouds, so I think it's better to use panel power output to decide what to do during the day. But I may explore using the Sun component in a future version to sleep all through the night instead of waking up every few minutes to fruitlessly check power level.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, I don't need to worry about stopping battery charging. I can supply 5V all day when panel delivers power, and trust the USB power bank charging circuit to keep the battery from being overcharged. But keeping lithium-ion cells full would shorten their useful life, so in the interest of battery longevity I'll stop charging before full. On that topic: for optimal battery life I should charge it slowly over the course of the day, but I don't have control over charging rate used by USB power bank.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One thing I don't know yet is how the system will handle several rainy days in a row. I assume this panel can still generate enough power to charge an 18650 battery cell, but I might be wrong! I'll have to wait for a long stretch of rain to come to Southern California, which may be a long wait. After seeing its behavior I can adjust for a future version.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here's version 1 of my ESPHome configuration YAML, and I expect to fine tune various hard-coded threshold values over the weeks ahead while <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/03/19/vertically-mounted-construction-experiment/">I build more projects</a>:</p>
