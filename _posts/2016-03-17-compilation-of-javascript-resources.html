<p>The benefit of JavaScript is that there are a ton of resources. The downside of JavaScript is that there is so much, it's hard to figure out where to start and who to believe.</p>
<p>After the expected period of beginner fumbling, I now know a few things to be incorrect. But more importantly, I now know many things to have no single Right Answer(™). JavaScript is so flexible that there are many ways to do many things and not much to differentiate one from another except personal preference.</p>
<p>This makes me wary of advice compiled on somebody's blog, because that's really their personal opinion and I don't know if I necessarily agree with that person's priorities.</p>
<p>But if the collection of resources was assembled by a group of people, that makes me a little more comfortable. So I was happy to stumble across <a href="http://jstherightway.org/">JSTheRightWay.org</a>.</p>
<p>The name seemed pompous and arrogant, but the introduction made me feel like I've found a good thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a guide intended to introduce new developers to JavaScript and help experienced developers learn more about its best practices.</p>
<p>Despite the name, this guide doesn't necessarily mean "the only way" to do JavaScript.</p>
<p>We just gather all the articles, tips, and tricks from top developers and put it here. Since it comes from exceptional folks, we could say that it is "the right way", or the best way to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'll be coming back to this page quite frequently. May it live up to my hopes!</body></html></p>
