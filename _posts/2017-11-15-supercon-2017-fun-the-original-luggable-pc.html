<p>I named my Luggable PC project after the original IBM PC clone by Compaq. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_Portable">Compaq Portable</a> was the computer that started the PC clone market that is still going strong today. It picked up the nickname "luggable PC' because it was roughly the size and weight of a sewing machine. I've seen pictures in books and on web sites, and occasionally I see a unit on display in a museum somewhere. I never expected to see and touch a running unit.</p>
<p>So I was pleasantly surprised (and amazed!) to see one at <a href="https://hackaday.io/superconference/">Hackaday Superconference 2017</a>. It was brought in by Ariane Nazemi, who gave a talk about mechanical keyboards and brought the Compaq as one of his visual aids showing old-school mechanical keyboards. Chatting with Ari I learned one of his hobbies is to restore old computers to running condition. So the original luggable was not just a demonstration piece, it was an actual functional computer.</p>
<p>One of the optional equipment available for the Compaq Portable was a Computer Graphics Adapter. The CGA resolution of 320x200 is has long since been surpassed by modern equipment. But it isn't very far off from the conference badge camera's resolution of 128 x 128. And that's probably why Ari worked to incorporate the Compaq into his badge project. I didn't want to bother him while he's focused on getting it to work, but I did ask to take a picture of my Luggable PC sitting next to the original while he worked.</p>

<p>I had looked forward to his project presentation at the end of the conference, but I missed it because I had to take care of some administrative tasks. Alas.</p>
<p>It was great to have these two sit side-by-side and see over thirty years of progress in PC hardware evolution.</p>
