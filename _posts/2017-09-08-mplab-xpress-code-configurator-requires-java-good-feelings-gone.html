<p>Getting started with the <a href="https://mplabxpress.microchip.com">MPLAB Xpress</a> development system, I've been impressed by what I saw. Microchip's PIC platform has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontroller">a lineage that goes all the way back to 1976</a> but the new web-based tools show they are making serious effort to move the development experience into 2017. A HTML-based code editor, cloud-based compilation, download to local computer, and USB storage device based hardware interface making it accessible to every modern computer with an internet connection.</p>
<p>I had compiled a few pre-built examples to try out the process and feeling pretty good about the whole thing. Until the time came for me to create a new project from scratch. The boilerplate code for a new project sets up all the parameters tailored to the features and peripherals of a specific PIC chip, and the tool to take care of all these details is the "MPLAB Xpress Code Configurator" (MCC).</p>
<p>So far so good, I clicked on the blue "MCC" icon, and got this.</p>

<p>...Java?</p>
<p>The sound in my head is of screeching tires punctuated by the crunching metal of a car crash. Maybe they have ambition to move PIC development into 2017, but today starting a new MPLAB Xpress project requires a trip back to 1995 when Java was king.</p>
<p>If MCC was a web-browser based Java applet, we would be completely out of luck as <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/firefox_java.xml">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml">Chrome</a> both dropped support due to all the security nightmares the past few years, and those were the only two browsers I have installed on my Ubuntu development system.</p>
<p>Fortunately MCC is a client-side application launched with a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/deploymentInDepth/jnlp.html">JNLP</a> file so there is still some hope. I tried the open-source Java implementation first, but <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=859630">icedtea-netx does not work</a> at the moment. So off to Oracle I go to download the official closed-source binaries which got me past this blocker.</p>
<p>In hindsight I should have created a virtual machine (probably with <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>) and installed Java only in that VM to contain any possible damage from future Java security vulnerabilities. I'll do that on my next clean install of Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Back to MCC: it feels like a chunk of legacy code carried over to today's MPLAB Xpress. Having to install Java is very much counter to their "nothing to setup or install" pitch so I expect they will migrate MCC functionality to be HTML-based as well.</p>
<p>Hopefully it'll just be a matter of time.</p>
