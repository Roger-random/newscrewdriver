<p>Following default instructions, I was able to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/13/developer-mode-and-crouton-on-toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340/">put Ubuntu 16 on a Chromebook in developer mode</a>. But the current LTS (Longer Term Support) release for ROS (Robot Operating System) is their "M" or <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation">Melodic Morenia</a> release whose corresponding Ubuntu LTS is 18. (Bionic Beaver)</p>
<p>As of this writing, Ubuntu 18 is not officially supported for Crouton. It's not explicitly forbidden, but it does come with a warning: "May work with some effort." I didn't know exactly what the problem might be, but given how easy it is to erase and restart on a Chromebook I decided to try it and see what happens.</p>
<p>It failed failed with a hash sum failure during download. This wasn't the kind of failure I thought might occur with an unsupported build, download hash sum failure seems more like a flawed or compromised download server. I didn't understand enough about the underlying infrastructure to know what went wrong, never mind fixing it. So in an attempt to tackle a smaller problem with a smaller surface area, I backed off to the minimalist "cli-extra" install of Bionic which skips graphical user interface components. This path succeeded without errors, and I now have a command line interface that reported itself to be Ubuntu 18 Bionic.</p>
<p>As a quick test to see if hardware is visible to software running inside this environment, I plugged in a USB to serial adapter. I was happy to see <code>dmesg</code> reported the device was visible and accessible via <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>. Curiously, the owner showed up as <code>serial</code> group instead of the usual <code>dialout</code> I see on Ubuntu installations.</p>
<p>A visible serial peripheral was promising enough for me to proceed and <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu">install ROS Melodic</a>. I thought I'd try installation with Python 3 as the Python executable, but that went awry. I then repeated installation with the default Python 2. Since I have no GUI, I installed the <code>ros-melodic-ros-base</code> package. Its installation completed with no errors, allowing me to poke around and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/15/first-few-issues-of-ros-on-ubuntu-on-crouton-on-chrome-os/">see how ROS works in this environment</a>.</p>
