<p>The <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/283094400379">laser distance sensor I bought off eBay</a> successfully managed to send data to my desktop computer, and the data looks vaguely reasonable. However, I'm not interested in a static scanner - I'm interested in using this on a robot that moves. Since I don't have the rest of the robot vacuum, what's the quickest way I can hack up something to see how this LIDAR unit from a Neato XV-11 works in motion?</p>
<p>Obviously something on the move needs to run off battery, and there's already a motor voltage regulator working to keep motor speed correct. So that part's easy, and attention turns to the data connection. I needed something that can talk to a serial device and send that data wirelessly to my computer. There are many ways to do this in the ROS ecosystem, but in the interest of time I thought I'd just do it in the way I already know how. A Raspberry Pi is a ROS-capable battery-powered computer and everything I just did on my computer would work on a Pi. (The one in the picture here has the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2327">Adafruit servo control PWM HAT on board</a>, though the HAT is unused in this test.)</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi is powered by its own battery voltage regulator I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/07/distributing-power-inside-sawppy-the-rover/">created for Sawppy</a>, supplying 5 volts and running in parallel with an identical unit tuned for 3 volts supplying power to spin the motor. As always, the tedious part is getting a Pi on the wireless network. But once I could SSH into the Pi wirelessly, I could run <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node">all the ROS commands I used on my desktop</a> to turn this into a mobile distance data station. Reading in data via FTDI serial port adapter, sends data out as ROS topic <code>/scan</code> over WiFi.</p>
<p>Using a Raspberry Pi 3 in this capacity is complete overkill - the Pi 3 can easily shuttle 115200 bps serial data over the network. But it was quick to get up and running. Also - theÂ FTDI is technically unnecessary because a Pi has <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/uart.md">3.3V serial capability on board that we could use</a>. It's not worth the time to fuss with right now but something to keep in mind for later.</p>
<p>Now that the laser is mobile, it's time to explore its behavior on the move...</p>
