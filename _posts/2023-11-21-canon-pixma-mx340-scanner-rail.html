<p>A flatbed scanner is part of a Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet, and I've freed it from <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/20/canon-pixma-mx340-damper/">its associated hinges and damper</a>. Once freed it was relatively straightforward to remove all visible fasteners and work around the perimeter to pop loose all remaining clips. I lifted the glass top and found it surprisingly empty inside.</p>

<p>During normal operation I could see the scanning head and two ribbon cables through the glass. I had expected to find more components hidden along the sides out of sight. At least a switch or sensor for the scanning head to find its home position. But there's nothing, just structural ribbing and empty space.</p>

<p>One ribbon cable led to an assembly with visible gears, so it's probably the motion control cable.</p>

<p>There weren't anything else holding the scanning head in place, so I could flip it over to confirm four wires consistent with a stepper motor. The curious part is I counted five conductors in the long white ribbon cable. Either I miscounted or there's an extra wire I lost track of, for purpose I have yet to determine.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I count twelve conductors inside the other ribbon cable, leading to one end of the scanning head assembly. I guess image data comes across this wire. While the ribbon cable and its associated connector are too small for me to work with, I see at least five through-hole pins on a circuit board and I could work with that. It's something to look into more detail later.</p>

<p>The other end of the scanning head has a spring to help keep the imaging hardware tight against the bottom of the glass surface.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I was surprised to find two separate pieces of glass. One for the large whole-page scanning window, and a separate narrower piece works with the automatic document feeder. I had expected a single piece of glass spanning across those windows. Why did Canon engineers decide two separate pieces were better than a single piece? There must be a good reason for increasing parts count and assembly complexity. Do these two pieces have different optical characteristics? Or maybe it's a supply chain volume thing. The large piece would be a high-volume piece usable on all printers and scanners, whereas the small window glass is lower volume only applicable to machines equipped with an automatic document feeder.</p>

<p>The glass pieces were about 3.45mm thick, far thicker than I had thought they were. I guess I got too used to LCD glass that are <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/07/13/polarizer-film-transfer-experiment/">less than a millimeter thick and easily cracked</a>. I've always been scared to accidentally crack the glass on a scanner bed, thinking they were just as thin and fragile as display glass. Now I know better. They're still glass so I should still treat them with care, but I won't be afraid to breathe on them anymore. Another feature I appreciated is that their corners have been beveled so I'm less likely to cut myself open on these edges.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Seeing how robust they are, I'm inclined to remove these pieces of glass for reuse elsewhere. They seem to be held in place by double-sided tape. Peeling off the tape and cleaning any remaining residue should be trivial for a glass surface.</p>

<p>While looking over the glass, I noticed this distinct pattern of three black stripes on a white background hiding underneath the bar between the two visible scanning windows. I think this explains the lack of a physical homing switch. Rather than adding hardware for a homing switch, the imaging sensor (which needs to be on a scanner anyway) is used to look for this pattern indicating home position. I wonder if I can spoof it by printing this pattern on a sheet of paper? That's a potential experiment for later. Right now, because I wanted to keep the entire machine functional, I had to put the scanning module back together. That's the easiest way to keep this stripe in place and visible to the scanning head while I go off and play with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/11/22/canon-pixma-mx340-print-head-parking-area/">the rest of the device</a>.</p>
