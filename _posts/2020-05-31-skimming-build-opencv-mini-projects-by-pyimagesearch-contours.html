<p>Getting <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/30/skimming-build-opencv-mini-projects-by-pyimagesearch-colors/">a taste of OpenCV color operations</a> were interesting, but I didn't really understand what made OpenCV more powerful than other image processing libraries until we got to contours, which covers most of the second half of <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/start-here/">PyImageSearch's Start Here guide</a> <em>Step 4: Build OpenCV Mini-Projects</em>.</p>
<p>This section started with an example for <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/02/01/opencv-center-of-contour/">finding the center of a contour</a>, which in this case is examining a picture of a collection of non-overlapping paper cut-out shapes. The most valuable concept here is that of <em>image moments</em>, which I think of as a "summary" for a particular shape found by OpenCV. We also got names for operations we've seen earlier. <em>Binarization</em> operations turn an image into binary yes/no highlight of potentially interesting features. Edge detection and thresholding are the two we've seen.</p>
<p>Things get exciting when we start putting contours to work. The tutorial starts out easy by <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/11/finding-extreme-points-in-contours-with-opencv/">finding the extreme points</a> in contours, which breaks down roughly what goes on inside OpenCV's <code>boundingRect</code> function. Such code is then used in tutorials for <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/03/28/measuring-size-of-objects-in-an-image-with-opencv/">calculating size of objects in view</a> which is close to a project idea on my to-do list.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for that project is code to <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/03/21/ordering-coordinates-clockwise-with-python-and-opencv">order coordinates clockwise</a>, which reading the code I was surprised to learn was done in cartesian space. If the objective is clockwise ordering, I thought it would have been a natural candidate for processing in polar coordinate space. This algorithm was apparently originally published with a boundary condition bug that, as far as I can tell, would not have happened if the coordinate sorting was done in polar coordinates.</p>
<p>These components are brought together beautifully in an <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/01/build-kick-ass-mobile-document-scanner-just-5-minutes/">example document scanner application</a> that detects the trapezoidal shape of a receipt in the image and performs perspective correction to deliver a straight rectangular image of the receipt. This is my favorite feature of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/office-lens/9wzdncrfj3t8">Office Lens</a> and if I ever decide to write my own I shall return to this example.</p>
<p>By the end of this section, I was suitably impressed by what I've seen of OpenCV, but I also have the feeling a few of my computer vision projects would not be addressed by the parts of OpenCV covered in the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/06/01/skimming-remainder-of-pyimagesearch-getting-started-guide/">rest of PyImageSearch's Start Here guide</a>.</p>
