<p>Contemplating <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/03/11/battery-options-for-solar-monitor/">options for powering my current project</a>, I decided to repurpose an old USB power bank I bought nearly ten years ago. The primary problem with this device is that today's devices expect more power than it could deliver. Specified to output up to one amp, I don't think it could deliver that anymore. Most of my USB devices would cause it to shut down instead of charge. Another problem with this device is that its soft-touch outer plastic shell has become sticky. It is now impossible to keep clean and unpleasant to touch. It sat unused for several years in this state but now I have a potential use so I proceeded to violate the "Do Not Open" warning on the label.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There were no fasteners in the plastic shell to help disassembly, I just had to dig into seams and start prying it apart. Carefully, because puncturing a lithium-ion battery cell would be very bad news and electronics are still powered by said battery. (Use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Prying_and_Opening" target="_blank">plastic tools</a>!) Once the plastic shell was removed, we are left with the functional guts of the device:</p>

<p>The green cylinder is a lithium-ion battery cell in the very common 18650 (18mm diameter, 65mm length) form factor.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what MH27311 or ICR18650 meant exactly, but a web search found them sprinkled liberally across many eBay listings for lithium battery cells. I infer these were designations for a line of batteries that were popular enough to become eBay keyword salad. The next figure is the important one: nominal capacity of 2600 milliamp-hours. Nominal voltage of 3.7V is typical for lithium-ion cells. Finally, a date of December 2nd, 2013. This is probably the manufacturing date, though it would contradict the "Date: 2013-10" written on the outside label. Maybe it's actually February 12th, 2013? <a href="https://xkcd.com/1179/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dates are hard</a>.</p>

<p>Onward to the electronics, which were a pleasant surprise. They are two circuit boards connected to each other through two rows of four pins &amp; sockets. I had expected a single circuit board or multiple circuit boards bonded together in some difficult-to-remove way. I didn't expect nice easy pin and socket setup.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Here are the two sides of the first circuit board:</p>

<p>The top circuit board hosted the minimal user interface: four LEDs indicators (LED1 through LED4) and a push button (SW1). This side also has all of the designations printed on it: MS-B2600MPW-PC-A REV:A0 FR4 2013-5-4 26.3X18.5X1.2mm. The other side is dominated by an IC that presumably runs the show. I suspect it is a chip specifically designed to run a USB power bank, but there are no markings for me to investigate further. I also see globs of sturdy yellow material (epoxy?) that holds the chip in place as well as reinforcing the infamously fragile micro USB connector.</p>

<p>One side is dominated by connectors: one USB-A connector and two rows of four-pin connectors. Nestled between them is an electrolytic capacitor and soldering points for the battery cell labeled BT+ and BT-.</p>

<p>I thought I might see signs of damaged component somewhere that would explain the poor power output performance of this thing, but if present I don't recognize them. That's fine, I don't intend to use the 5V output portion of this device anyway. I'll <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/03/13/usb-power-bank-charging-looks-ok/">quickly test</a> the portions I actually need.</p>
