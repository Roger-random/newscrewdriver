<p>I was fascinated by virtual reality and my frugality was tempted by Google Cardboard's promise of phone-based virtual reality on the cheap. But eventually I had to face the reality <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/06/google-cardboard-and-friends/">I wasted a lot of money on disappointing hardware</a>. They were limited to tracking rotation in x, y, and z axes. (3DOF = three degrees of freedom.) I wanted <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/05/my-virtual-reality-a-ha-moment/">the magic I first experienced with an Oculus Rift DK2</a> so in 2018 I committed to spend money necessary to move beyond phone-based systems (*) for a PC-based system that tracks both rotation <em>and translation</em> in x, y, and z. (6DOF)</p>

<p>For many years the market consisted of a duopoly between Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Then Microsoft convinced multiple PC hardware manufacturers to sell 6DOF VR headsets conforming to Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mixed_Reality">Windows Mixed Reality</a> (WMR) specification. While still expensive pieces of hardware, they were slightly more affordable than earlier offers. Competition is good!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>No matter which way I went, though, I still needed to upgrade my desktop PC video card and that had been the bigger barrier. The cryptocurrency craze made a new GPU financially unfeasible for many years. Around the middle of 2018 I found a workaround to crypto frenzy: <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/06/03/in-a-distorted-computer-component-market-buying-is-better-than-building/">a laptop computer with a VR-capable GPU</a>. Laptops are not cost-effective for cryptocurrency mining, nor could <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/07/desktop-pc-component-advantage-sustained-performance/">their cooling systems sustain performance</a> for cryptocurrency math around the clock. I wanted a laptop anyway and the cost premium of stepping up to a VR-capable unit was a relative bargain compared to desktop video cards being gobbled up. Around the time I got that laptop, the initial launch wave of WMR headsets like the HP Windows Mixed Reality headset model VR1000-100 could be found at a discount. As newer headsets had released, and first-gen needed discounts to be competitive.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I snapped up that bargain and as soon as I started moving around in my new HP headset, I knew the extra money was worthwhile. 6DOF tracking gave me a sense of immersion that 3DOF tracking could not match. I was glad to be back in the kind of world promised by that Oculus DK2 years ago, and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/08/hp-windows-mixed-reality-headset-vr1000-100/">I enjoyed my visits to PC-based virtual worlds</a> far more than I ever enjoyed phone-based virtual experiences.</p>

<p>(*) The Oculus Quest, which launched in 2019 (about a year after this) is a 6DOF VR system that operated standalone without requiring a supporting PC. It had a lot of commonalities with high-end phones like a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and the Android operating system. It is, however, definitely not a phone.</p>
