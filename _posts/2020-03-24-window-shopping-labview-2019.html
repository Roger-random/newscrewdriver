<p>After taking a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/23/window-shopping-keysight-vee-custom-data-display/">quick look over Keysight VEE</a>, I switched focus to <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html">LabVIEW by National Instruments</a>. I don't know how directly these two products compete in the broader market, but I do know they have some overlap relating to instrument control. I had some exposure to LabVIEW many years ago thanks to LEGO Mindstorms, which had used a version of LabVIEW for programming the NXT brick. Back then the Mindstorm-specific version was very closely guarded and, when I lost track of my CD-ROM, I was out of luck because neither NI nor LEGO made it available for download. Thankfully that has since changed and the Mindstorm flavor of LabVIEW is <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview-for-lego-mindstorms.html">available for download</a>.</p>
<p>But I'm not focused on LEGO right now, today's aim is to see how I might fulfill my general computer control goals with this tool. For that information I was thankful National Instruments made help files for LabVIEW available for download so I can investigate without a <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview.html">full download and installation of the full tool suite</a>. It took a bit of hunting around to find them, though, and <a href="https://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361R-01/">the download page was titled LabVIEW 2018</a> but it has a download link for the 2019 help files.</p>
<p>I found a help page "Serial Port Communication" under the section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling Instruments
<ul>
<li>Types of Instruments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And it assumes the user would only be controlling devices that can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_instrument_software_architecture">communicate to VISA protocol</a>, not general serial communication. There were more serial communication information in the section:</p>
<ul>
<li>VISA Resource
<ul>
<li>I/O Session
<ul>
<li>Serial Instr</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also an <a href="http://www.ni.com/tutorial/3511/en/">online tutorial for instrument communication</a>. This page has a flowchart that implied there's a "Direct I/O" that we can fallback to if all else fails, but I found no mention for performing this direct I/O in the help files.</p>
<p>The graphics rendering side was more straightforward. There's no mention of ActiveX control here, but under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals
<ul>
<li>Graphs and Charts
<ul>
<li>Graphics and Sound VIs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are multiple pages of information for a "2D Picture Control" with drawing primitives like points, lines, arcs, etc. Details on this drawing API are found under:</p>
<ul>
<li>VI and Function Reference
<ul>
<li>Programming VIs and Functions
<ul>
<li>Graphics &amp; Sound VIs
<ul>
<li>Picture Plot VIs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's not clear this functionality scales to complex drawings with thousands (or more) of primitives. It certainly wouldn't be the first time I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/01/08/accelerate-fusion-360-api-object-creation-with-directdesigntype/">used an API that stumbled as the data size grew</a>.</p>
<p>So the drawing side looks workable pending a question mark on how well it scales, but the serial communication side is blocked. Until I find a way to perform that mystical direct I/O, I'm going to set LabVIEW aside and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/25/window-shopping-labwindows-cvi/">look at its sibling LabWindows/CVI</a>.</p>
<p>[UPDATE: I've since found <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/24/windows-shopping-linx-connecting-labview-to-maker-hardware/">LabVIEW MakerHub and LINX</a>, which allows LabVIEW to communicate with maker level hardware over serial.]</body></html></p>
