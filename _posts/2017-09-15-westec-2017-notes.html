<img class=" size-full wp-image-11858 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/westeclogo.png" alt="westeclogo" width="250" height="72">Courtesy of Tux-Lab, I got a chance to attend <a href="http://www.westeconline.com/">WESTEC </a>2017 on a free exhibits-only pass. Sort of like how I got in SIGGRAPH 2017 exhibits. And just like SIGGRAPH, I was not the target audience and much of the show went over my head. Half of the time I would stare at a company's booth and be at a complete loss as to what their product or business was. Fortunately, since I attended on the third and final day with tapering traffic, most of the exhibitors had spare time to explain what they do. The marketing manager for <a href="https://www.sw-machines.de/en.html">SW</a> was even nice enough to chat about career and life advice on dealing with people in general. Well above and beyond the treatment I had expected for someone not remotely a prospective customer.</p>
<p>But it's not all gawking. I had hoped to find a few businesses that might be interesting to work with, and fortunately there were some vendors present who are willing to work with small volumes and short production runs. In fact, a few places specifically cater to it. <a href="http://www.roncelli.com/">Roncelli</a> is just down the street for machined plastic components, and <a href="http://www.hilltop21.com/">Hilltop</a> across town is similar for metal. If I'm willing to have the product shipped, there are smaller shops like <a href="http://avidpd.com/">Avid Product Development</a> and large operations like <a href="https://www.protolabs.com/">Proto Labs</a>.  Proto Labs feels like <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>, but instead of jewelry and trinkets, they cater to making precision parts for actual products and have the infrastructure (and price tag) to match.</p>
<p>But those were the exceptions. For the bulk of the vendors I'm just there to look at the nifty machines. The <a href="http://www2.vollmer-group.com/en/lp/vgrind/vgrind-360.html">Vollmer Vgrind 360</a> caught my attention because it was "backwards": The carbide cutting tool I saw wasn't doing the cutting - it was <i>being </i>cut by precision grinding wheels. Another CNC grinder was made by a machine tool company named <a href="http://www.haas-schleifmaschinen.de/en/">Haas</a>, but it has no relation to the <a href="https://www.haascnc.com/index.html">Haas </a>machine tool company I knew of.  Fortunately I was assured I'm not the first person to get confused.</body></html></p>
