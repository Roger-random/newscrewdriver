<p>Once we followed through <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/10/18/notes-on-tour-of-heroes-tutorial-2-selection-list/">previous steps of the tutorial,</a> we had enough code in our tutorial project to demonstrate benefits of componentization by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt3" target="_blank">creating a feature component</a>. This is when I really started to get a grasp of the power of Angular componentization and the potential for how it helps make large projects more organized. I've never tackled web application projects large enough to really benefit, but maybe that was because I was not looking forward to juggling a bunch of structure-less JavaScript files! I suppose whether one views this componentization as a good thing will depend on whether they feel JavaScript's general flexibility (a.k.a. freedom from organization) a bug or a feature.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I had hoped they would continue discussion project organization to how this relates to Angular modules, but they did not. I assume Angular modules apply the similar concept to a larger scale, each module a collection of components, but I don't know for sure and haven't seen how it would be useful.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The componentization tutorial has one aspect unique among all of these tutorial pages: After following through all the steps on the page, the end-user visible web app <em>looks exactly the same</em>. All our effort was spent organizing code behind the scenes without disturbing the user facing visible appearance. I thought it was neat but some may find it pointless. Either way, this would be the last time we "do nothing" in this tutorial. Following changes <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/10/20/notes-on-tour-of-heroes-tutorial-4-adding-services/">are more consequential</a>.</p>
