<p>I want to learn Budibase and I hope it will be a tool to solve <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/08/23/resurrecting-project-idea-personal-finance-software/">my "Excel is not a database" situation with my personal finance tracking</a>. Keeping that project in mind to anchor my study, I returned to <a href="https://docs.budibase.com">Budibase documentation</a> ready to learn more. They had an excellent "Overview" page, followed by an informative "Quickstart" project. Given those two precedents, I had expected "Quickstart" to be followed by a smooth ramp-up for beginners. Turns out I was overly optimistic. I found a significant gap between "Quickstart" and the knowledge needed to build my own Budibase app.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Going down the documentation index sidebar, "Quickstart" is followed by "Guides and resources". This is a collection of solutions to common problems, sometimes called a recipe cookbook. I'm sure it's a great resource, but for a beginner like myself coming right out of "Quickstart", a cookbook is not what we need. Beginners lack experience to understand the solutions being offered. Even worse, we don't even necessarily understand the problems being solved. I suffered a similar problem when <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/13/node-red-cookbook-was-more-useful-after-some-experience/">I encountered the Node-RED cookbook</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After the "Getting Started" section, Budibase documentation had sections titled "Data", "Design", and "Bindings" but I saw nothing telling a beginner how they tied together. I was undaunted -- I've been in similar situations before -- so I dove in to read those sections and learn what I can. There were a lot of cross-referencing in those sections (each had references to the other two) meaning it wouldn't help to read the three sections in any particular order. I had to accept I wouldn't understand everything the first pass. Then, after reading all three sections once, return to read them all a second time. Only then did I feel I have a basic grasp of how a Budibase app worked.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I think there's room for improvement here. If my experience is representative, I could see potential Budibase users getting discouraged trying to jump over this post-"Quickstart" gap. In hindsight, I think a few sentences at the end of the "Quickstart" guide would have gone a long way to help. Here's my first draft:</p>

<p>This tutorial covered the core of every Budibase app, but things will be done differently beyond a tutorial.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Obviously real Budibase apps will not use our sample data. Visit <em><a href="https://docs.budibase.com/docs/data">Introduction to data</a></em> to see how Budibase can work with your data.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>This tutorial used autogenerated screens to get started quickly with a generic table interface. A good application will tailor an interface to best display and interact with its underlying data. <em><a href="https://docs.budibase.com/docs/working-with-data">Data in design</a></em> goes into more details on how to do so.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Our autogenerated tables also handled linking data between database and user interface elements. These links are called bindings and <em><a href="https://docs.budibase.com/docs/introduction-to-bindings">Introduction to bindings</a></em> covers how to define them.</li>

<p>I might submit this, or an evolution of it, as a proposed contribution after I get some Budibase experience to be confident this is actually correct. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/08/25/initial-budibase-documentation-lessons/">There's a lot to learn</a>.</p>
