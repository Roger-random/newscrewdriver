<p>When I decided to release Sawppy to the world, I thought briefly about how to best organize all the information I want to convey for rover assembly. I quickly fell into a state of Analysis Paralysis and, as a path out of that state, decided that it was better to have something written down whatever the format. No matter how unorganized, is still better than keeping it all in my head.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I first tried putting it in the "Build Instructions" section of <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/158208-sawppy-the-rover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sawppy's Hackaday.io page</a>, but that feature has some strange and unpredictable limitations that became annoying as the length of instructions grew. The final straw was when I noticed that images and instructions for earlier steps were disappearing as I added later steps. That made me... unhappy, so I went to something else.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The second attempt is what I have as of today: a loose collection of Markdown files <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Roger-random/Sawppy_Rover" target="_blank">on a Github repository</a>. Edited in a code editor rather than a word processor, I struggled with typos and grammatical errors as I lacked the usual automated proofreading tools present in a word processor. Still, with a large helping of assembly pictures, it was just barely enough to help other people build their own rovers.</p>

<p>I was painfully aware of the fact there is a ton of obvious room for improvement. This was just the "get it written down" first stage and at some point I need to revisit the various problems still open. The most significant of which is lack of structure beyond an index page with links to all the other pages. The index suggested a relative ordering that matched my personal assembly order, but that doesn't necessarily work for anyone else. And worse, they would be stuck if they wanted to ask some specific questions my layout is <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/03/sawppy-documentation-shortcoming-example-wheel-axles/">unable to answer</a>.</p>
