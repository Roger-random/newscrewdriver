<p>For the VFD driver project, there were <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/13/why-and-how-of-simpler-pic-display-driver/">software design motivations</a> to keep things simple. But that's not the whole picture, there were also motivation from hardware constraints too. My previous projects to make a PIC drive a multi-segmented LED display had fairly simple wiring that connected most output pins of my PIC to current-limiting resistors. A few of the lines could have seen current flow higher than what a PIC is capable of handling, and those were handled with simple transistors. I knew there existed chips designed specifically to drive LEDs, but I wanted to learn the principles of controlling one myself.</p>
<p>Building something to drive a VFD requires dealing with voltages different and sometimes far higher than what is required to drive LED display modules. During our <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/02/sleuthing-nec-vsl0010-a-vfd-control-pinout/">probe of this specific VFD</a> we saw 2.5V AC and 30V DC, atypical of logic circuits. And just as there existed dedicated LED driver chips, there exist chips <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/HV5812">specifically designed to drive VFD modules</a>, but again the project goal was to learn by building one ourselves.</p>
<p>So we turn to our standard electronic hobbyist toolbox item for controlling power and voltage beyond what our standard parts can handle: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ULN2003A">ULN2003A line</a> of Darlington arrays. The go-to solution for controlling inductive loads like relays and small motors, it can handle voltages up to 50V which we need for a VFD.</p>
<p>And again, with multiple different display projects on the horizon, it didn't make sense to create a controller with hardware pinout specifically tailored to a specific unit. To keep things simple and consistent across displays, all of our controller outputs will be either left floating or tied to ground. If a particular device desires a particular pin to be at a higher voltage, we'll have to wire up a pull-up resistor on that device's specific interface board. We will learn if this concession to consistency will cause problems down the line.</p>
