<p>I've had my head buried in <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/03/hp-stream-7-refuses-to-believe-in-free-energy/">modern LED-illuminated digital panels</a>, so it was a good change of pace to switch gears to old school CRTs for a bit. Several months have passed since I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/25/cat-and-galactic-squid/">added animated GIF support</a> to my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/esp_8_bit-color-composite-video-library/" target="_blank">ESP_8_BIT_Composite video out Arduino library</a> for ESP32 microcontrollers. I opened up the discussion forum option for my GitHub repository and a few items have been raised, sadly I haven't been able to fulfill the requests ranging from NTSC-J support (I don't have a corresponding TV) to higher resolutions (I don't know how). But one has just dropped in my lap, and it was something I can do.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Roger-random/ESP_8_BIT_composite/issues/21" target="_blank">Issue #21</a> was a request for the library to implement <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/rotating-the-display" target="_blank">Adafruit GFX capability to rotate display orientation</a>. When I first looked at rotation, I had naively thought Adafruit GFX would handle that above <code>drawPixel()</code> level and I won't need to write any logic for it. This turned out to be wrong: my code was expected to check rotation and alter coordinate space accordingly. I looked at the big CRT TV I had sitting on my workbench and decided I wasn't going to sit that beast on its side, and then promptly forgot about it until now. Whoops.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Looking into Adafruit's generic implementation of <code>drawPixel()</code>, I saw a code fragment that I could copy:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>  int16_t t;
  switch (rotation) {
  case 1:
    t = x;
    x = WIDTH - 1 - y;
    y = t;
    break;
  case 2:
    x = WIDTH - 1 - x;
    y = HEIGHT - 1 - y;
    break;
  case 3:
    t = x;
    x = y;
    y = HEIGHT - 1 - t;
    break;
  }</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Putting this into my own <code>drawPixel()</code> was a pretty straightforward way to handle rotated orientations. But I had overridden several other methods for the sake of performance, and they needed to be adapted as well. I had <code>drawFastVLine</code>, <code>drawFastHLine</code>, and <code>fillRect</code>, each optimized for their specific scenario with minimal overhead. But now the meaning of a vertical or horizontal line has become ambiguous.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Looking over at what it would take to generalize the vertical or horizontal line drawing code, I realized they have become much like <code>fillRect()</code>. So instead of three different functions, I only need to make <code>fillRect()</code> rotation aware. Then my "fast vertical line" routine can call into <code>fillRect()</code> with a width of one, and similarly my "fast horizontal line" routine calls into <code>fillRect()</code> with a height of one. This invokes some extra computing overhead relative to before, but now the library is rotation aware and I have less code to maintain. A tradeoff I'm willing to make.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>While testing behavior of this new code, I found that Adafruit GFX library uses different calls when rendering text. Text size of one uses <code>drawPixel()</code> for single-pixel manipulation. For text sizes larger than one, they switch to using <code>fillRect()</code> to draw more of the screen at a time. I wrote a program to print text at all four orientations, each at three different sizes, to exercise both code paths. It has been added to the collection of code examples as <code>GFX_RotatedText</code>.</p>

<p>Satisfied that my library now supports screen rotation, I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Roger-random/ESP_8_BIT_composite/releases/tag/v1.3.0" target="_blank">published it as version 1.3.0</a>. But that turned out to be incomplete, as I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/05/arduino-library-versioning-for-esp_8_bit_composite/">neglected to update the file <code>library.properties</code></a>.</p>
