<p>For my computer-controlled camera project, I thought it would be good to let the user control position via arrow keys on the keyboard. My quick-and-dirty first attempt failed, so I dived into UWP documentation. After spending a lot of time <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/21/tab-and-arrow-keys-getting-in-each-others-way/">reading about nuts and bolts of keyboard navigation</a>, I finally found my problem and it's one of the cases when the answer has been in my face the whole time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When my key press event handlers failed to trigger, the first page I went to is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/keyboard-events" target="_blank">Keyboard Events</a> page. This page has a lot of information up front and center about eligibility requirements to receive keyboard events, here's an excerpt from the page:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>For a control to receive input focus, it must be enabled, visible, and have IsTabStop and HitTestVisible property values of true. This is the default state for most controls.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My blindness was reading the word "control" in the general sense of a visual element on the page for user interaction. Which is why I kept overlooking the lesson it was trying to tell me: if I want keyboard events, I have to use something that is derived from the UWP <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.control" target="_blank">Control</a></code> object. In other words, not "control" in the generic language case but "Control" as a specific proper name in the object hierarchy. I would have been better informed about the distinction if they had capitalized Control, or linked to the page for the formal Control object, or any of a number other things to differentiate it as a specific term and not a generic word. But for whatever reason they chose not to, and I failed to comprehend the significance of the word again and again. It wasn't until I was on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/accessibility/keyboard-accessibility">Keyboard Accessibility</a> page did I see this requirement clearly and very specifically spelled out:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Only classes that derive from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Control"><strong>Control</strong></a> support focus and tab navigation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The <code><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.captureelement">CaptureElement</a></code> control (generic name) <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/16/webcam-test-with-uwp/">used in the UWP webcam example</a> is not derived from <code><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.control">Control</a></code> (proper name) and that's why I have not been receiving the keyboard events. Once I finally understood my mistake, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/23/user-interface-taking-control/">it was easy to fix</a>.</p>
