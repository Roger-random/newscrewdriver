<p>Moving my RXBB8 project website <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/10/migrate-rxbb8-com-from-aws-to-github-pages/">from AWS to GitHub Pages</a> has another benefit: now it is trivially simple to update. I push a change, and GitHub default Action will handle publishing. Much easier than copying the files over to an AWS S3 Bucket like I had to do earlier. Which means it is a great time to make (what's very likely) the final update to this project site.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First, I updated the content of the page, adding a shorter version of what I've posted earlier: Why <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/08/rxbb8-plasti-dip-after-six-years/">I decided to say goodbye</a> to RXBB8, and then <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/09/removing-rxbb8-plasti-dip/">the process of actually doing so</a>. Illustrated with the same image files I used here. I decided against following the precedence of providing a "web" (low resolution) and "full" (high resolution) copies of each image. For this final update, I'm providing only the web resolution image. Previous content is largely untouched except for one point: instead of link to "latest activity" on social media Facebook and Instagram, I updated it to be past tense and added Twitter as well.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After the content was updated, I updated the behind-the-scenes infrastructure as well. I had used the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/01/11/let-the-app-materialize/">Materialize-CSS library</a> for this project, and I thought I would be six years out of date. (Fortunately given it is a static site, the chances of a dangerous security flaw are quite low.) Then I looked at <a href="https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/releases">Materialize-CSS library releases</a> and realized I was only about a year out of date. The library reached version 1.0.0 on September 2018 at which point activity stopped. Since it is done I thought I should download the version 1.0.0 CSS and JavaScript files for direct inclusion on my site. There's no longer any worry of falling out of date, but now there is the worry of the project distribution site disappearing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since I only used some superficial capabilities of the library, I did not expect anything to break and visually everything looks fine. I did notice one advancement, though: version 1.0.0 no longer depends on jQuery, so I removed the line loading jQuery from my page.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Is this the end of my interaction with Materialize-CSS? Maybe, maybe not. There's a potential upside of a library frozen in 2018 at version 1.0.0: It <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/01/21/windows-phone-8-1-browser-effectively-a-separate-platform-now/">probably still works on Windows Phone browser</a>. I will likely revisit Materialize-CSS if I want to work with Windows Phone browser again. And even if the project site disappears, I have a copy of the library CSS and JavaScript now.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And finally, I added <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> to the top of the page. Because <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/05/31/angular-signals-code-lab-css-requires-no-quirks-mode/">I've learned that could be important</a>.</p>
