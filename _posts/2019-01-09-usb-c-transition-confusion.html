<p>Today's little research adventure came courtesy of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/07/25/two-notes-of-happiness-on-new-dell-inspiron-15-7000-7577/#comments">a comment on one of my earlier posts</a>: my Dell 7577 laptop has a USB-C port. Some laptops - like the latest Apple MacBook - charge through their USB-C ports. Does that mean I can charge my Dell through its USB-C port?</p>
<p>Well... no. No I can't. But it was an interesting experiment.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-17608 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dell-7577-usb-c-charging-no-go.png" alt="dell 7577 usb c charging no go" width="515" height="215"></p>
<p>As is my usual habit, my first thought was to find if there's any mention in the <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/us/en/04/inspiron-15-7577-laptop/inspiron-15-7577-setupandspecs">online version of my manual</a>.Â  Clicking on the "Power" section had the usual information about a standard Dell AC adapter but no mention of USB-C charging. Clicking on the "Ports and Connectors" section returns a list that listed several functions for the USB-C port, but that list did not include power.</p>
<p>However, it was still an impressively long list! I had not realized the full extent of what a USB-C connector could do. I was first introduced to this connector with my Nexus 5X cell phone, and I was happy enough just to have a charge connector that had eliminated frustration with orientation.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-17610 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/usb-orientation.gif" alt="usb orientation" width="500" height="300"></p>
<p>But it's not just convenience, USB-C tries to solve an impressive set of problems all with a single connector. The fact it can transfer data was a given due to USB legacy, and I knew it could transfer more power than older USB connectors from the aforementioned Apple MacBook. But it wasn't until I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)#Thunderbolt_3">Wikipedia page on Thunderbolt 3</a> that I realized how wide the ambition spread.</p>
<p>Not just low-speed data like classic USB, but there's also the option for high speed video data in the form of DisplayPort support. And that's not all - it can tap into a computer's internal high speed PCI bus. This part of the spec is how some laptops could utilize external GPU enclosures. Such a wide range of capability explains why Apple decided their latest laptops need only USB-C plugs: one plug can handle all the typical laptop port duties.</p>
<p>But as my blog comment pointed out, there's also the risk for customer confusion. A USB-C port might do all of these things someday, but clearly not all USB-C ports could do everything today. One marvel of our current system is that, for the most part, if a plug fits into a port then it is the right plug for the right port. Now we're moving away from that. Sure, it's nice the protocol negotiation allows the computer to throw up a dialog box telling me I can't charge through my USB-C port, but would it have been better to avoid this confusion to begin with?</p>
<p>Maybe one day we'll get to the point where every USB-C port can do everything, bringing us back to the "if it fits, it works" world we once had. In the meantime, there's going to be a lot of confusion. Let's see how the industry adopts USB-C over the next few years...</p>
