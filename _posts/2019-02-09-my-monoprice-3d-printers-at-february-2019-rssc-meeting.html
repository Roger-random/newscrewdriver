<p>When I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/12/sawppy-presented-at-january-2019-rssc-meeting/">presented the story of my Sawppy rover project</a> last month at the January 2019 meet of Robotics Society of Southern California (RSSC) I made an offhand comment about my 3D printers. Later on, in a discussion on potential speakers, there were people who wanted to know more about 3D printers and I offered to summarize my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/category/3d-printing/3d-printing-hardware/">3D printer experience</a> in a follow-on talk. Originally scheduled for March, I asked to be rescheduled when I realized the March RSSC meet would take place at the same time as <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/17x">Southern California Linux Expo</a> (SCaLE).</p>
<p>My talk (<a href="https://1drv.ms/p/s!BE-SQhDpVdvoloA7abLKquW9hmUYKg">presentation slide deck</a>) starts with a disclaimer that my experience and knowledge was limited. I started by explaining why I chose Monoprice printers backed by a short history lesson on Monoprice because that sets the proper expectations. Then I ran through my three Monoprice printers: the Select Mini, the Maker Select V2, and the Maker Ultimate. Each of these printers had their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Monoprice Select Mini</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple low-cost printer that still covers all the basic concepts of FDM printers.</li>
<li>Closest we have to a "Fisher Price My First 3D Printer"</li>
<li>Recommended for beginners to find out if they'll like 3D printing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monoprice Maker Select</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic Prusa i3 design.</li>
<li>Easiest to take apart for modifications and/or repairs.</li>
<li>Recommended for people who like to tinker with their equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monoprice Maker Ultimate</p>
<ul>
<li>Design "inspired by" Ultimaker.</li>
<li>Highest precision and most reliable operation.</li>
<li>Recommended for people who just want their equipment to work.</li>
<li>But price level approaches that of many other good printers, like a genuine Prusa i3.</li>
</ul>
<p>I brought my printers to the meet so interested people can look them over up close. I did not perform any print demos, because I've almost certainly knocked the beds out of level during transit. Plus, I forgot my spools of filament at home. But these are robotics people, they can gain a lot just by looking over the mechanical bits.</body></html></p>
