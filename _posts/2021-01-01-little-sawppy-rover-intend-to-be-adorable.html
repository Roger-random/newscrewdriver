    rover takes first steps! This is an early prototype to make sure wheel and suspension
    parts work together as designed. Real rovers <a href="https://twitter.com/MarsCuriosity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MarsCuriosity</a>

<p>I do tend to catch myself <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/12/31/accommodate-3d-printer-variation-with-crush-ribs/">obsessing over tiny mechanical implementation details</a>, and I have to periodically remind myself that they all have to work in service of overall project goals. The primary goal of the little Sawppy rover is to make a DIY motorized 3D-printed Mars rover model accessible to people that would be otherwise excluded by the larger rover. A lower cost to make it within reach of those who found Sawppy too expensive. Fewer parts and easier to build for those who found Sawppy too complex. Which has a side effect of a smaller size for those who found Sawppy too big and bulky.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The smaller size also opened another path that I wanted to explore: not just a little rover, but a cute little rover. Sawppy mostly followed the scale and proportions of Curiosity rover. Most of the deviations came from when I made sacrifices to make parts easier to 3D print. But as soon as I saw the cute rover illustration for JPL's <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/06/mars-bound-rover-perseverance/" target="_blank">Mars 2020 naming contest</a> I knew I wanted to make a rover that willingly sacrifices scale fidelity in order to gain physical appeal. This was reinforced when I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/12/15/quick-look-esa-exomy-rover/" target="_blank">learned of ExoMy</a>. Which took the designs of ESA ExoMars mission rover <em>Rosalind Franklin</em>, and turned it into a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackaday.com/2020/09/05/exomy-is-a-miniature-european-mars-rover-with-a-friendly-face/" target="_blank">cute rover with a smiling face</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My little Sawppy rover can't help but look cute next to a full size Sawppy, like a duckling following around mama duck. Rather than putting up any futile effort to fight it, I plan to lean into the cute angle. Aside from just the sheer fun of it, I also hope a cute appearance will make the project appealing and attract an audience who would otherwise be less interested in a mechanically faithful scale model.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>From a design standpoint, this means changing around some proportion on the little rover. Adapting counterparts to traits that we humans instinctively associate with young animals. Following ExoMy's lead, a little rover will start with the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Replace the mast camera assembly with a larger anthropomorphic face as ExoMy did. This is analogous to how young animals have larger heads relative to their body and big eyes on those heads.</li>
<li>Shorten individual segments of the rocker-bogie suspension, corresponding to proportionally shorter limbs of young animals.</li>
<li>Wheels that are larger than scale, emulating proportionally larger feet of young animals. However, this is less important than the previous item: once the suspension segments are shortened, the wheels will naturally look larger in comparison even if I don't make them larger than scale.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But that is only a starting point, there are many other potential ideas along those lines:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Faster motors and a drive system that allows it to come across as high-energy relative to more sedate "grown up" rovers.</li>
<li>If some sort of vocalization are to be added, the little rover would have a higher pitched voice.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I expect it'll take several iterations before I get a decent design for a little Sawppy rover. Lessons learned and incorporated as I go, starting with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/02/micro-sawppy-beta-1/">prototype number one</a>.</p>
