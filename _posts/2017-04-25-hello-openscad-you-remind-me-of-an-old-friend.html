<img class=" size-full wp-image-4953 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/helloopenscad.png" alt="HelloOpenSCAD" width="1274" height="791">OpenSCAD is a very popular 3D modeling tool in the 3D printing community. Many of the projects available to print on <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> were generated from OpenSCAD. This is most obvious when authors uploaded their .scad files for sharing with the community, but also visible as a core pillar of the "customizable things" section. The customization capability is made possible by variables the author made adjustable in OpenSCAD.</p>
<p>I started designing for 3D printing with the GUI CAD tools, Onshape and Fusion360, so the text-based approach of OpenSCAD seemed strange and foreign at first glance. The official OpenSCAD web site documentation pointed to several tutorials. Not knowing the comparative advantage of one versus another, I just clicked on the first in the list <em><a href="http://www.tridimake.com/2014/09/how-to-use-openscad-tricks-and-tips-to.html">How to use OpenSCAD</a></em>. It linked to several other tutorials, the most notable one being <em><a href="https://cubehero.com/2013/11/19/know-only-10-things-to-be-dangerous-in-openscad/">Know only 10 things to be dangerous in OpenSCAD</a></em> as having the most compact words-to-content ratio.</p>
<p>I had initially approached it as "Boy it's going to be hard to completely change my thinking" but as I got along in the tutorial I realized things didn't feel as foreign as I thought it might be. Digging through musty memories, I realized I had encountered this type of 3D modeling (CSG or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">Constructive Solid Geometry</a>) before many years ago in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POV-Ray">POV-Ray</a>. Back in the days when a 20-megahertz 386 was a pretty speedy CPU, and the floating point processor wasn't a standard part of every PC. I had to upgrade my computer with the purchase of a 387 math co-processor in order to render my POV-Ray projects at a reasonable speed.</p>
<p>Editing CSG files for rendering in POV-Ray was my first exposure to 3D computer graphics, and I chose it because it was free. I couldn't afford GUI graphics software (the flagship at the time was Autodesk 3D Studio) so I started with the basics and I learned a lot that way. In time, I might appreciate the straightforward simplicity of OpenSCAD in the same way.</body></html></p>
