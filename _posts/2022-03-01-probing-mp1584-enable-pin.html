<p>I want to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/28/investigating-mp1584-for-solar-power/">use a MP1584 buck converter module for a solar-powered project</a>, and to explore its behavior I used a bench power supply to vary volage input from zero volts up to expected operating voltage. I heard an audible screech from the circuit within the 3-5 volt range and decided not to go further until I better understood what's going on.</p>

<p>The first step to problem solving is always to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read The Fine Manual</a>, in this case <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/documentview/productdocument/index/version/2/document_type/Datasheet/lang/en/sku/MP1584EN-LF-Z/document_id/204/" target="_blank">MP1584 data sheet published by Monolithic Power Systems</a>. The first surprise was the big read "NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NEW DESIGNS REFER TO MP2338" stamped across every page. I guess this chip is getting phased out by Monolithic, and at some point I will have to learn about a different chip. But that doesn't matter today so I proceeded to read about its startup behavior. Specifically the EN (Enable) pin on this chip. According to this document, MP1584 will start up when EN is above 1.5V.</p>

<p>Great, what does that mean for my little board, purchased from Amazon from the lowest bidder that day? I laid the board flat and started probing. From what I can tell, the EN pin is connected to a straightforward voltage divider ladder, using two resistors of equal value. These little surface mount resistors have "104" printed on them, indicating they are 100kÎ© plus or minus some percentage of tolerance.</p>

<p>Here is the same image in light grayscale, and I filled some color into the relevant areas.</p>

<p>EN trace is in blue, and its circuit board trace immediately goes under the chip to emerge to the left moving up. Running between the two poles of a capacitor(?) it reaches the two voltage dividing resistors. The top resistor bridges between EN and ground, which I filled in black. The lower resistor bridges between EN and voltage input, which I filled in red. Vin can be seen connecting to the Vin solder pads to the upper right.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>A voltage divider with two equal value resistors means voltage of EN will be half of input voltage. To test this hypothesis, I soldered a wire to this pin so I could measure its voltage as I vary the input voltage. A small 5mm LED module was connected to MP1584 output. This is a self-cycling unit that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3va9O0G" target="_blank">quickly flashes through different colors from</a><a href="https://amzn.to/3va9O0G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3va9O0G" target="_blank">RGB mixes</a>.(*) I used it here because it tolerates a slightly wider range of input voltage and current than just a single diode, plus it is inexpensive and disposable in case something went wrong with this experiment.</p>

<p>Clipping a voltage meter to the blue wire, I quickly confirmed the hypothesis is correct. EN voltage is approximately half of input. Therefore, if a MP1584 activates at 1.5V, this circuit will activate with 3V input. This is a problem when the potentiometer has been adjusted for 3.3V output. This is a buck converter. It lowers voltage and could not raise it! No wonder it was unhappy and screeched its displeasure.</p>

<p>But now that I have a basic understanding of how this module decides to come alive, I could <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/03/02/raising-mp1584-enable-voltage-by-replacing-resistor/">modify it to suit</a> the project at hand.</p>
