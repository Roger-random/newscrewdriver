<img class=" size-full wp-image-18326 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pic16f18345-vfd-driver-pcb.jpg" alt="PIC16F18345 VFD driver PCB" width="1600" height="900">Motivated by the desire to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/05/dusting-off-past-pic-led-driver-projects-for-potential-vfd-driver/">get an old VFD up and running for fun</a>, I set up my PIC16F18345 to act as an I²C peripheral. I could write my own code from scratch, or I could build on top of boilerplate code published by Microchip for implementing an I²C slave device. My problem is that I had two choices - <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/06/i2c-on-pic-microchip-foundation-services-library-is-less-beginner-friendly/">the new thing that doesn't compile, or the old thing that is deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>I've since figured out how to resolve the two error messages to compile the new thing, formally called Foundation Services Library.</p>
<p>The first compiler error message was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>In file included from mcc_generated_files/USBI2C_app.c:25:</code><br />
<code>mcc_generated_files/drivers/i2c_slave.h:55:34: error: unknown type name 'interruptHandler'</code><br />
<code>void i2c_slave_setReadIntHandler(interruptHandler handler);</code><br />
<code>^</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Searching elsewhere in the generated boilerplate, I found a declaration for <code>interruptHandler</code> in another different header file. Copying it into <code>i2c_slave.h</code> addressed the "unknown type name" error.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>typedef void (*interruptHandler)(void);</code></p></blockquote>
<p>However, that error was replaced by a warning that there are now duplicate declarations of <code>interruptHandler</code>. This seems silly - if there were a declaration to collide with, it should not have thrown an unknown type name error signifying the declaration's absence.</p>
<p>MPLAB should either not throw the error, or not raise the warning, but it is doing both. I have yet to figure out if the toolchain is busted or if the boilerplate code is. For now, though, I could proceed to the next problem.</p>
<p>The second compiler error message was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>mcc_generated_files/USBI2C_app.c:30:14: error: no member named 'SSP1IE' in 'PIE3bits_t'</code><br />
<code>PIE3bits.SSP1IE = 1;</code><br />
<code>~~~~~~~~ ^</code><br />
<code>1 error generated.</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This one was easier to figure out - go into the header files for this chip and look for SSP1IE. I found it declared on PIE1bits instead of PIE3bits. So to get this code to compile, I changed the boilerplate code from this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>void USBI2C_Initialize(void){</code><br />
<code>PIE3bits.SSP1IE = 1;</code><br />
<code>i2c_slave_open();</code><br />
<code>}</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>To this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>void USBI2C_Initialize(void){</code><br />
<code>PIE1bits.SSP1IE = 1;</code><br />
<code>i2c_slave_open();</code><br />
<code>}</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>What does <code>PIE1bits.SSP1IE</code> actually do? I'm not sure so I'm not positive this is actually the correct fix. But at least all of the foundation boilerplate compiles, and I start browsing through sample code for MikroElektronika <a href="https://www.mikroe.com/usb-i2c-click">USB-I2C Click module</a> to figure out what it does and what I can do with it. Reading through code and comments, I saw this comment block.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>- This module only supports byte operations. Block read and write operations is </code><br />
<code>not yet supported by MCC Foundation I2C Slave Drivers.</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This comment implies Microchip has decided to deprecate their previous I²C library even though the new library is unable to duplicate important functionality. If true, this is... unsatisfactory. I want block read and write operations for my project.</p>
<p>Now I'm even more motivated to stay with the old code, but unfortunately there were <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/12/old-microchip-mcc-boilerplate-for-mssp-requires-c90-compatibility-mode/">some complications with that</a>, too...</body></html></p>
