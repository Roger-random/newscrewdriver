<p>The <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/19583-luggable-pc">Luggable PC project page on Hackaday.io</a> has been fully documented for anybody to build their own home-built 3D-printed computer chassis. All the components required for assembly have been listed, and all the steps of assembly documented with pictures taken at each and every step.</p>
<p>I expect to continue to make small tweaks to the design, improving little things here and there, but the machine is usable enough that I should stop tinkering with it and actually start using it. This means no new versions rebuilt from scratch for the foreseeable future. But if inspiration strikes, there will be!</p>
<p>When I've taken my Luggable PC to various maker events in the local area I've received generally positive reception and appreciation. Now I wait to see if anybody actually takes me up on the information compiled and build their own.</p>
