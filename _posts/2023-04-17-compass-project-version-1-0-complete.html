<p>Along with source code, GitHub code repositories have an "Issues" section for tracking problems. I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/04/16/compass-web-app-workarounds/">logged the outstanding problems and their workarounds</a> for my Compass project. Since fixing them are outside of my control, I am going to declare version 1.0 complete. Now to wrap up before moving on to something else.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The primary goal of this project was to practice working with Angular framework, and that goal is a success. I knew going in that Angular wouldn't be the best tool for the job: its architecture was designed to handle much larger and more complex web apps than my Compass. But I wanted a chance to practice Angular with something small, and Compass succeeded at that.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An entirely expected consequence of my initial decision is a web app far larger than it needs to be. I knew from earlier experiments a bare-bones Angular app doing nothing more than <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> start at over 200 kilobytes. I wasn't too impressed by that, but as a practical matter I accept this is not considered huge in today's web world. I found an online tool https://bundlescanner.com/ which lists download sizes for the given URL, and most of the sites I visit weigh in at several megabytes. Even the legendarily lightweight Google home page <a href="https://bundlescanner.com/website/google.com">downloads over 300 kilobytes</a>. Judged in that context, 200 kilobytes of overhead are unlikely to be a dealbreaker by themselves. Not even in space-constrained situations, thanks to the fact <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/18/hello-espasyncwebserver/">it compresses very well</a>.</p>

<p>Since it's such a small app, I didn't touch upon very much beyond Angular core. I created just two components, one (compass-needle) inside the other (capability-check) so there was no routing at all. (It is literally a 'single-page application'). I created two services who distributed information via RxJS, but I didn't need to deal with server communication over a network. It's good to start small to get over beginner hurdles. My next Angular practice project can be more complex to expand my exploration frontier.</p>

<p>Unrelated to Angular, one thing I knew I needed to practice -- and I got lots of it here -- was CSS layout. This was the first project where I used media queries to react to portrait vs. landscape orientations, and it was great practice towards more responsive layouts in future projects. I know people can do great things with CSS, but I don't count myself among them. I foresee a lot more hair-pulling in the future as I struggle to declare CSS rules to create what I have in my mind, but that's the journey I know I need to take.</p>
