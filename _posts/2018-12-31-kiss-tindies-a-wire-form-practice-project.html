<p>After I built a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/28/a-copper-wire-body-for-tindie/">very simple copper wire body</a> for a Tindie blinky, I wanted to advance my copper wire forming technique with practice making something a little more complex. Looking on my workbench of stuff, the most obvious candidate for a follow-up project are the KISS Tindies given out at <a href="https://hackaday.io/superconference/">Hackaday Superconference 2018</a>. They were the demonstration objects in a workshop on <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/02/26/successful-experiments-in-multicolor-circuit-boards/">pad printing</a>Â - people were invited to apply red to these circuit boards and take them home. Not everyone took theirs home, so extras were distributed to other interested Supercon attendees like myself.</p>

<p>So I could create some copper wire bodies for the band. It wouldn't make sense to give the same dog bodies to these heads - these call for some stylized human-like poses. I thought I would have to dig deep into my meager artistic skills to draw a guitar-playing puppy, but it turns out art already existed for these heads. (It's possible these PCB heads were actually made from the art - I don't have the history here.)</p>

<p>Unlike the puppy, though, there wasn't an obvious way for me to separate these shapes into a "front" and "back" for the two voltage planes. I thought I might try to make fully three-dimensional bodies but a few tests indicate I don't yet have enough skills as a copper wire sculptor to pull it off.</p>
<p>Scaling my ambitions back down to match my current skill level means the next project will take a slight step backwards in functionality: they will be flat figures, and the body won't be a functioning circuit. The focus of this exercise is to practice wire forming on a flat plane.</p>
