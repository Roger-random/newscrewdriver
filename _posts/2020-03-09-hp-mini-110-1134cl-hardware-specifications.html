<p>After a quick check to make sure this machine <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/07/hp-mini-110-1134cl-relic-of-the-netbook-era/">comes to life after charging</a>, I started researching its hardware specifications. A sticker below the machine identified itself as a <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-mini-110-1100-pc-series/4004509/model/4041541/product-info">HP Mini 110-1134CL</a>.</p>
<p>Based on reviews online for the HP Mini 110 product line, this is roughly ten years old powered by an <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/36331/intel-atom-processor-n270-512k-cache-1-60-ghz-533-mhz-fsb.html">Atom N270 processor</a>. This is a big strike against <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/08/30/the-spectrum-of-ros-robot-brain-candidates/">using this computer as a robot brain running ROS</a>, as the N270 is limited to 32-bit software. The latest longer-term support distribution of ROS "<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation">Melodic Morenia</a>" only officially supports 64-bit Intel/AMD chips. If this machine is to run ROS, it would be limited to the previous LTS of ROS "<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation">Kinetic Kame</a>" which is not ideal, but at least it will be <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions">supported until April 2021</a>.</p>
<p>According to BIOS readout, there is 1GB of RAM installed on this computer. An access door with a memory module icon is visible on the underside of the machine, so a RAM upgrade is probably possible. But I don't have any old memory modules on hand and I'm not inclined to spend money upgrading a ten year old computer. A single gigabyte is expected to be very limiting, but it is possible to get a very basic ROS installation running on a Raspberry Pi 3, which also only has 1GB. It might get annoying but is probably not going to be a deal breaker.</p>
<p>The BIOS hardware list also describes the hard drive as an old school spinning platter type, which was as expected. Thankfully the Fujitsu MJA2160BH G2. A 2.5" 160GB 5400 RPM is at least a standard SATA drive and not the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/23/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-sata-but-not-as-i-know-it/">compact variant that stumped me earlier</a>. This means I have the option to try upgrading it with one of the SATA SSD drive I already have on hand.</p>
<p>Now that I'm oriented, it's time to take on the first experiment: <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/10/hp-mini-110-1134cl-slow-at-ubuntu-16-desktop/">see if it can run Ubuntu 16</a>, the basis for ROS Kinetic Kame.</p>
