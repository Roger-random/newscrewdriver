<p>There's nothing like a deadline to drive progress, so I've imposed deadlines on myself to keep things moving. For Luggable PC Mark II Revision B, the self-imposed deadline was to get it finished (enough) to show at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Hackaday-Los-Angeles/events/241819235/">Hackaday LA August Meetup</a>. It was a mad scramble towards the end, cutting fancy feature ideas in favor of simple ones that can be done quickly within the deadline. But I made it! I took it on the Metro Gold Line train to the meetup venue SupplyFrame DesignLab. Here's a picture somebody took of rev B sitting on the projects show-and-tell table.</p>

<p>I always forget to take pictures of my own project while at a Hackaday meetup... I'm too excited talking about my project. I'm not visible in this picture. The location I spent most of my chatting time is blocked by the person with white polo shirt on the right.</p>
<p>Many Hackaday LA regulars are familiar with my Luggable PC Mark I, and might even be getting tired of it. Mark II was a fresh take and attracted a new wave of attention. It is always fun to share my projects with like-minded people.</p>

<p>A downside of mad scrambles to meet deadlines is overdose. I'm enthusiastic about Mark II and there's still lots to problems I need to fix with rev B.... but after the deadline scramble I'm ready for a break before I start working on rev C.</p>
<p>I was planning to go back to learning Python, but they had a giveaway at this meetup and I was granted a <a href="http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DM164141">Microchip MPLAB Xpress PIC16F18345 Evaluation Board</a>. Getting some basic familiarity with these low-power (in both computation power and electrical power) microcontrollers had been on my to-do list for some time. Now that a PIC microcontroller board has dropped in my lap, I might as well run with it!</p>
