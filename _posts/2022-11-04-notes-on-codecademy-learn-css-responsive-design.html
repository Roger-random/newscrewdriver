<p>Following <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/11/03/notes-on-codecademy-learn-css-transitions-and-animations/">a quick tour through CSS transition animations</a>, next course on the Codecademy CSS curriculum is "<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-responsive-design" target="_blank">Learn CSS: Responsive Design</a></em>". Up until this point, Codecademy CSS curriculum had primarily demonstrated concepts using unit measurement of pixels. This course brings us into the real world where pages have to adjust themselves to work well on devices ranging from 4.5" cell phone screens to 32" desktop monitors.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first focus is on typography, since most pages are concerned with delivering text for reading. Two measurements work based on font size: em is relative to the base font size of a particular point in the HTML tree, varying relative to its hierarchy. rem ignores the hierarchy and goes directly to root &lt;html&gt;.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next, we move on to percentages, which are calculated based on the parent width of an element. There were a few paragraphs dedicated to how height calculations are based on parent width instead of parent height, but I didn't understand why. There was an example of how parent height could be affected by child height so using percentages would cause a circular reference problem, which I understood. But wouldn't the same problem occur on the width dimension as well? We can specify child width as dependent on parent width, and parent width dependent on contents (child width.) Why wouldn't this cause the very same circular dependency? I don't understand that part yet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When I first started trying to write a HTML-based UI for controlling SGVHAK and Sawppy rovers, I learned of a chunk of HTML that I needed to put into phone-friendly HTML. I didn't understand what it meant, though, it was just "copy and paste this into your HTML".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code {"fontSize":"small"} --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code has-small-font-size"><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With this class I finally got this item checked off the "need to go and learn later" list. Codecademy even included a pointer to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag#viewport_basics" target="_blank">a reference for viewport control</a>. This viewport control reference mentioned a few accessibility concerns, but I don't really understand them yet. I expect to learn more HTML accessibility soon as it is listed later in Codecademy CSS curriculum.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Viewport led into media queries, another essential tool for pages to dynamically adjust between desktop, tablet, and phone usage. Most of the examples reacted to viewport width, which I understand to be the case most of the time in the real world. But this barely scratched the surface of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries" target="_blank">media features we can query for</a>. The one most applicable to my rover UI project is the "orientation" property, because that will let me reposition the virtual joystick when the phone is held in landscape mode.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most of this course consisted of making changes in CSS then manually resizing our browser window to change viewport width and observe its effects. But again, width is but one of many media features that can be queried, and it's not obvious how we can explore most of the rest. I wish this course included information on how to test and debug media query issues using browser developer tools. Such a walkthrough was quite informative in the JavaScript course and its absence here is sorely missed. A quick web search found the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inspect-and-trigger-css-media-queries/" target="_blank">Media Query Inspector</a> which looked promising at first glance, I'll have to dig into that later. For now, it's onwards to Codecademy's <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/11/05/notes-on-codecademy-learn-css-variables-and-functions/">CSS Variables and Functions</a>.</p>
