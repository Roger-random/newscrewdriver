<p>To help optimize arrangement of Luggable PC components, I sketched them out in Fusion 360 so I can experiment with layout in CAD space. I was able to find the specification for the <a href="http://www.formfactors.org/developer/specs/atx2_1.pdf">ATX motherboard</a> and <a href="http://www.formfactors.org/developer/specs/ATX12V_1_3dg.pdf">power supply</a>, which allowed me to use official dimensions. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do the same for the PCI-Express cards, because I needed to be a member of the PCI SIG to access <a href="https://pcisig.com/specifications/pciexpress">the official specs</a>. So I measured and guessed dimensions from the specific implementation I have on hand.</p>
<h4>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h4>
<p>As the heaviest single component, I wanted the PSU at the bottom so the overall system is not top-heavy. The question is then: which way to orient the PSU? There were two considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>PSU cooling intake:</strong> The standard ATX case layout places the PSU at the top of the case, drawing air from beneath. I can't do that with the PSU at the bottom since a downward-facing intake would be blocked by the table surface. I tried the upward-facing intake once, in the <a href="http://newscrewdriver.com/2017/01/21/homebuilt-all-in-one-mini-itx-computer/">Mini-ITX "Easel Frame 2.0"</a> design. That turned out to be a bad idea because every time I dropped something (usually a screw) it would fall inside the PSU and I have to retrieve it to avoid short-circuiting the internals.</li>
<li>
<strong>PSU wiring</strong>: One side of the PSU takes the standard IEC AC cable. The opposite side is where all the DC wires go to the rest of the components. The decision is then whether to point them front-back or left-right. I didn't want either of them to point towards the user, so I went with a left-right orientation for the wiring.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking care of those two considerations leave two good orientation for the PSU. One with the cooling intake facing front towards the user, or facing away from the user. In the current design, facing backwards allows an unobstructed air path so that's the preferred position today.</p>
