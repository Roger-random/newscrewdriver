<p>The <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/16/micro-sawppy-beta-2-equipment-bay/">equipment bay</a> for my little rover Micro Sawppy Beta 2 (MSB2) had enough space for the temporary setup of Raspberry Pi 3 and Adafruit PWM/Servo HAT along with all wires and a battery. However, I'm trying to think ahead to more elaborate setups and how I might accommodate their needs. One obvious concern is that bigger computers would need more space <em>and</em> bigger batteries, both competing for room inside the equipment bay.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Mars rover engineers at JPL had already encountered this problem and we can see their solution: Curiosity and Perseverance draw their electrical power from a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG)</a>. Unlike their predecessors, who drew electrical power from solar panels that imposed a lot of operational limitations. Mars-bound RTG are large and bulky devices bolted prominently to the rear of those two rovers, giving them a very distinctive rump. Since MSB2 tries to look like the big rovers, it will also have a similar-looking attachment to the back, so we might as well make it serve the same purpose! (And to be clear I meant power supply, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/SawppyRover/status/1136702977501089792" target="_blank">not a radioactive generator</a>.)</p>

<p>Since MSB2 could fit its battery inside the main body, I didn't need to make this faux RTG functional just yet. For MSB2 it is only a test run mockup without any paths for power wiring. I found that if I made it according to proper scale, the mock RTG would be (just barely) large enough to accommodate a single 18650 lithium-ion cell. It also looks pretty easy to make the chamber easily accessible, so the battery could be swapped out.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/micro-sawppy-2-with-usb-power-bank.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-24015"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But with that success, my ambition grew: what if I could find a little more room? I could accommodate a USB power bank built around a single 18650 cell. If micro Sawppy could be built to run off a commodity USB power bank, that would make it a lot more beginner friendly. First, the construction would be simpler and second, beginners would be spared the learning curve of working directly with infamously temperamental lithium ion battery cells.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So that's another research project: what are the power requirements for a micro rover, and would it fit within the power delivery capabilities of a USB power bank? I know this specific USB power bank in my picture doesn't have the grunt to keep a Pi 3 running, so it is another motivation to scale down from the current electronics configuration to make room in the power budget for other component <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/18/micro-sawppy-beta-2-robot-arm/">like a robot arm</a>.</p>
