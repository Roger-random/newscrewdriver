<p>I outlined my Sawppy project and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/04/sawppy-documentation-system-challenges/">the challenges I want to tackle</a> to the combined <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/zvpphlybcnblb/" target="_blank">Write the Docs LA/SGVLUG meetup</a> on the evening of October 8th. Sawppy's current system of a loose set of Markdown files score highly on ease of contribution (challenge A) and ease of management (challenge B), but fall flat on querying dependencies (challenge C). What can I look into that helps improve information presentation without giving up the rest?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fundamentally speaking, challenge C is not new, as it would be desirable in any large scale engineering project. The novel twist here is the desire to do it all with a system that is inviting for public contribution. As a general rule, documentarians for large engineering projects are professionals who have undergone training and have licenses for proprietary software tools.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2>DITA</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most such tools are excluded from consideration due to cost, but many of them deal with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture" target="_blank">DITA</a>, an open XML-based data model for authoring and publishing under the custody of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OASIS_(organization)" target="_blank">OASIS consortium</a>. It is the standard answer to reassure customers wary of being locked in to proprietary file formats. And since it is an open format, there exists a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dita-ot.org/" target="_blank">DITA Open Toolkit</a> to transform DITA data to desired output formats... HTML, PDF, even  Markdown! There are learning resources at https://learningdita.com/</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a XML (and thus text) based format, DITA would be GitHub friendly for branching and merging. It is very flexible for creating any organization we want (creating a "Subject Schema" for DITA) but taking advantage of that power will take work. DITA Open Toolkit functions at a lower level relative to the other tools discussed later. A quick web search found many commercial offerings built on DITA (example: https://easydita.com/) but failed to find free open source counterpart.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So DITA is powerful, but that power comes at a cost, and I'll have to decide if the cost/benefit analysis comes out in favor. This also applies to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/06/sawppy-documentation-suggestion-bom-and-uml/">several other professional documentation concepts</a>.</p>
