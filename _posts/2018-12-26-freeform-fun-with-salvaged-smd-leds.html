<p>There's a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/12/04/the-circuit-sculpture-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freeform circuit contest</a> going on at Hackaday right now. I'm not eligible to enter, but I can still have fun on my own. I haven't had any experience creating freeform circuit sculptures and now is as good as time as any to play around for a bit.</p>
<p>Where should I start? The sensible thing is to start simple with a few large through-hole light-emitting diodes (LEDs), but I didn't do that. I decided to start higher up on the difficulty scale because of a few other events. The first is that I learned to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/11/sony-kp-53s35-signal-board-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">salvage surface mount devices (SMD) from circuit boards</a> with a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/05/cheap-seats-at-the-hot-air-gun-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cheap hot air gun</a> originally designed for paint stripping. I had pulled a few SMD LEDs from a retired landline telephone and they were sitting in a jar.</p>
<p>The second is the arrival of a <a href="https://amzn.to/2od8bP7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fine soldering iron tip</a>Â (*). I had ordered it in anticipation for trying to repair a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/11/15/miss-at-supercon-esp32-mesh-network-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damaged ESP32 module</a>. I thought I should practice using these new tips on something expendable before tackling an actual project, and a freeform exercise with salvaged SMD LED seems like a great opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>As a beginner at free form soldering, and a beginner at SMD soldering, the results were predictably terrible. I will win no prizes for fine workmanship here! But everyone has to start somewhere, and there will be many opportunities for practice in the future.</p>

<p>It's just a simple circuit with seven LEDs in parallel, on the lead of their shared current-limiting resistor. Not visible here is another aspect of learning to work with surface mount components: they are really, really small. I had actually salvaged nine LEDs. Two of the nine LEDs have flown off somewhere in my workshop and didn't make it to the final product.</p>

<p>For comparison, here is the "I &lt;3 SMD" soldering kit that was my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/07/20/a-gentle-introduction-to-surface-mount-soldering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gentle introduction to surface mount soldering</a>. The LED in that soldering kit were significantly larger and easier to manipulate than those I salvaged from an obsolete landline telephone.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: for future projects practicing SMD assembly, be sure to have spare components on hand to replace those that fly off into space.</p>
