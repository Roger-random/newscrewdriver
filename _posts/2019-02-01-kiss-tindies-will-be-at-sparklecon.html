<a href="https://www.sparklecon.org">SparckleCon IV</a>, the annual event held by <a href="https://www.23bshop.org/">23b Shop</a>, will be this upcoming weekend. It will be my first opportunity to attend and it looks like I'll be jumping in with both feet and presenting part of a talk. <a href="https://www.sparklecon.org/schedule/">Currently scheduled</a> for Sunday morning at 9AM, the topic is Hackaday and Tindie, with focus on the recently concluded <a href="https://hackaday.io/contest/162559-circuit-sculpture-contest">circuit sculpture project</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, there won't be any actual contest entries at the presentation, because staff members like myself were not eligible to enter. So I'm bringing the next best thing: my KISS Tindies band which I built because I thought circuit sculptures looked like fun.</p>

<p>The talk will be a condensed summary of my circuit sculpturing adventures documented on this blog. From my initial Tindie puppy, to my wire straightening tool, to the four members of the band and finally the drum set. The topic will neatly tie into both Hackaday and Tindie and it's my way of making sure I hit the standard points without being too much of a corporate commercial.</p>
<p>We'll see how successful the venture will be... my brain isn't typically working at its best Sunday mornings at 9AM, and some fraction of the conference attendees will be hungover in bed. I choose to see this as a positive thing: it's good practice for my public speaking skills, and any goofs would likely go unnoticed (or at least forgiven) by an equally night-owl-heavy crowd.</body></html></p>
