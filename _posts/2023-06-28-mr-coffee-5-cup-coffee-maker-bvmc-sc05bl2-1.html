<p>I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/27/phone-vr-headset-lenses/">taken apart my retired phone VR headsets</a>, so I'm moving on to retired appliances. This 5-cup coffee maker model number BVMC-SC05BL2-1 is the smallest and least expensive unit in Mr. Coffee product line. A direct counterpart to the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/04/14/black-and-decker-5-cup-coffee-maker/">Black &amp; Decker DCM600B coffee maker</a> I took apart earlier. I expect a machine with broadly similar implementation, as they're both just need to make some coffee while being simple enough to be sold for under $20 USD.</p>

<p>This specific unit could still perform its core duty of making coffee but was retired due to failure of a convenience feature.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here's the coffee maker with its top open, showing the filtering tray. It is sitting under the hot water spout which pivots out of the way.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the bottom of the filtering tray is a spring-loaded mechanism aligned to the top of the carafe.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mr-coffee-5-cup-filter-tray-valve-top.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-37637"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When the carafe is present, it pushes the mechanism upwards allowing coffee to drip through. If we remove the carafe while coffee was still brewing, this valve is supposed to close. This will temporarily stop the coffee from dripping, allowing a cup to be poured before the brewing is done.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After years of use, the soft (silicone?) seal has degraded and could no longer stop the flow of coffee. This meant coffee kept dripping when that early cup is poured, making a huge mess on the hot plate. The only way to avoid that is to wait for all five cups to finish brewing before pouring some coffee, and that was deemed unacceptable by its owner and thus was retired and given to me for teardown.</p>

<p>Valve mechanism came apart easily. Now on to the rest of the machine.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I was surprised to find a tri-wing security screw here. The previous coffee maker teardown also saw a security fastener of a different type. I don't know why both these companies felt simple basic bargain-priced machine justified security fastener protection.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aside from those two screws, the bottom was held by plastic clips that could be undone. With the bottom removed, we can see some of that coffee that flowed past the worn valve and sizzled onto the hot plate has made it to the bottom of the machine. The following information was stamped on the bottom:</p>

<p>The entire electrical circuit of this machine. Power cable leads to a power switch, which leads to a heating element controlled by a thermal switch.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One novelty is the ball check valve. It was a separate component installed in the water tube on the Black &amp; Decker machine. This machine molded the valve into the top half of the machine reducing parts count and assembly steps.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There were other minor differences, but I felt the molded-in check valve was the most novel. For the most part both machines were indeed nearly identical implementations of the same concept. I can say the same for <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/29/bodum-coffee-grinder-11160-3/">the second coffee grinder I took apart</a>.</p>
