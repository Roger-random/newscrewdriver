<p>A large part of the cost of a cordless drill system are in its batteries, so when this Makita cordless drill wore out its NiCad batteries, it made more sense to get a modern lithium-ion powered drill system to replace this one. Retiring it to the teardown workbench. I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/13/makita-ni-cd-battery-charger-dc1414/">tackled the charger first</a>, because I didn't think there was much point holding on to a NiCad/NiMH battery charger when lithium chemistries have taken over. Next up is the drill itself, which is an interesting comparison to an <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/12/24/disassemble-old-cordless-drill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even older cordless drill</a> taken apart at SGVHAK a few years ago.</p>

<p>The drill itself still works fine. As a powerful motor and gearbox combination with a torque-limiting clutch, I think it'll still be useful for something, so this is only a partial and nondestructive teardown in order to leave it in working condition. Thanks to excellent work by Makita designers and engineers, this turned out to be extremely easy.</p>

<p>One element of this ease is how this drill was held together by machine screws. Not self-tapping plastic screws, which are cheaper and easier to assemble but weaken every time they are removed and reinstalled. And those machine screws go into captive hex nuts, not heat-set inserts. Together, it means this drill can be disassembled and reassembled repeatedly without weakening. Nice!</p>

<p>After I removed all of the fasteners, I pried the two blue plastic halves apart. As I did so, all internal components fell out. It was startling at the time, but then I was happy to realize that it meant all internals are easily accessible and nondestructively so. Major subsystems fit together without any adhesives or additional fasteners.</p>

<p>I see the planetary gearbox has provision for fasteners to hold it onto the motor, but that provision was not used. It was not necessary: the drill enclosure held them against each other well enough for the drill to function. Speaking of that planetary gearbox, I see a few screws for further disassembly and decided against it. I wanted to keep the gearbox in running order, and I didn't want the mess of lubricants all over my workbench. Someday I might take it apart to see internal implementation of high/low gear shift and the torque-limiting clutch, but not today.</p>

<p>Control of motor speed and direction is handled by a completely integrated unit. It has solder points for battery terminals on one end, and motor terminals on the other. It exposes two mechanical controls: one for direction, and the trigger for speed. Printed on the side is:</p>

DGT-1225A
25A 14.4VDC</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>

<p>I found the website for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.defondetech.com/industries/power-tools/" target="_blank">Defond and its "Power Tools" division</a> that specializes in making such devices for other companies. I found no listing for DGT-1225A or a catalog at all, implying each product is a custom unit designed and built for a customer like Makita. More useful to me are the ratings printed on the side: up to 25 amps and 14.4V DC. This gives me the power envelope I must keep in mind if I want to incorporate this motor and gearbox into future projects. If I want to put them under a microcontroller's programmatic control, I'll need to use motor drivers capable of handling 14.4V * 25A = 360 Watts. Or perhaps I can <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/15/makita-ni-cd-battery-pack-1250/">rig up a different set of batteries</a>?</p>
