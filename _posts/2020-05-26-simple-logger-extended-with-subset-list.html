<p>One of the features about ETW I liked was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.foundation.diagnostics.logginglevel">LoggingLevel</a>. It meant I no longer had to worry about whether something might be too overly verbose to log. Or that certain important messages might get buried in a lot of usually-unimportant verbose details. By assigning a logging level, developers have the option to filter messages by level during later examination. Unfortunately I got lost with ETW and had to take a step back with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/22/simple-logging-to-text-file/">my own primitive logger</a>, but that didn't make the usefulness go away. In fact I quickly found that I wanted it as <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/23/communicating-with-3d-printer-added-a-twist/">things got complex</a>.</p>
<p>In my first experiment <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/UWPTest/tree/master/Hello3DP"><code>Hello3DP</code></a> I put a big text box on the application to dump data. For the second experiment <code><a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/UWPTest/tree/master/PollingComms">PollingComms</a></code> I have a much smaller text area so I could put some real UI on the screen. However, the limited area meant the verbose messages quickly overflowed the area, pushing potentially important information off screen. I still want to have everything in the log file, but I only need a subset displayed live in the application.</p>
<p>I was motivated to take another stab at ETW but was similarly unsuccessful. In order to resolve my immediate needs I started hacking away at my simple logger. I briefly toyed with the idea of using a small database like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite">SQLite</a>. Microsoft even put in the work for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/data-access/sqlite-databases">easy SQLite integration</a> in UWP applications. Putting everything into a database would allow me to query by LoggingLevel, but I thought it was overkill for solving the problem at hand.</p>
<p>I ended up adding a separate list of strings. Whenever the logger receives a message, it looks at the level and decides if it should be added to the subset of string as well. By default I limited the subset to 5 entries, and only at <code>LoggingLevel.Information</code> or higher. This was something I could pass into the on screen text box to display and notify me in real time (or at least within ~1 second) what is going wrong in my application.</p>
<p>Once again I avoided putting in the work to learn how to work with ETW. I know I can't put it off forever but this simple hack kicked that can further down the road.</p>
