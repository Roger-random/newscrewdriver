<p>There were <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/10/a-few-speed-bumps-on-the-road-to-esp8266-micropython/">a few speed bumps</a> on my way to a MicroPython interactive prompt, also known as REPL the read, evaluate, print loop. But once I got there, I was pretty impressed. It was much friendlier to iterative experimentation than Arduino on an ESP8266, because I don't have to reflash and reboot every time. And since the ESP8266 has WiFi capabilities, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/repl.html" target="_blank">getting REPL over the network (WebREPL)</a> is even cooler. Now I can experiment while it runs on another power source, completely <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/01/making-a-usb-data-only-cable/" target="_blank">independent of USB</a> for either power of data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before I got there, though, I needed to get this ESP8266 on my home WiFi network. By default, MicroPython sets up an access point for its own network so I need to turn "AP mode" off. Then I turn on "station mode" which allows connection to my WiFi router given its SSID and password.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import network

ap = network.WLAN(network.AP_IF)
ap.active(False)

sta = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
sta.active(True)
sta.config(dhcp_hostname='my hostname')
sta.connect('my wifi ssid','my wifi password')</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I added one optional element: the <code>dhcp_hostname</code> parameter. This is the name shown to my router and probably other devices on my home network. If I don't set this, the default name is "ESP-" followed by six hexadecimal digits of the ESP8266's MAC address. That's not a particularly memorable name so I wanted something I could remember and recognize.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And then, to my surprise, MicroPython remembered the network settings upon restart. I wrote a piece of Python code to perform this routine that I could run whenever I rebooted the board. But when I set out to test it by rebooting the board, it automatically reconnected to WiFi. This tells me a successful WiFi connection would cause a write to flash memory, which implies I should not run my WiFi connection code upon every startup. I expect to make this board go to deep sleep frequently and, if it writes WiFi information to flash every time it wakes up, I will quickly wear out the flash. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But that is just a hypothesis. As MicroPython is an open source project, it should be possible for me to <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dig into the code</a> and figure out exactly when MicroPython writes WiFi connection information to flash. Perhaps it isn't as bad as I feared it would be. Until then, however, I will hold off running my WiFi connection script.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A downside of not running my script is the DHCP hostname, which is not remembered upon reboot and this board reverted back to the default ESP-prefix name. But I can live with that for now, the next step is to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/12/second-esp8266-voltage-monitor-is-directly-wired-to-buck-converter/">set up my hardware</a> for playing with deep sleep under battery power.</p>
