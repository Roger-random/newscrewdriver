<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12632" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/haaslogo.png?w=300" alt="HaasLogo" width="150" height="124">I hadn't paid much attention to <a href="https://www.haascnc.com">Haas Automation</a> until recently. When I took my machining classes, there were no Haas machines in the school shop. My awareness of the company did not extend very far beyond the fact a Haas machine is on the cover of my textbook.</p>
<p>That changed recently because Tux-Lab is a fan of Haas Automation. The machine tools (which I aspire to operate) are all Haas machines. I started learning about them and the more I learned, the more I liked what I saw.</p>
<p>First, they are the Home Team. Based in Oxnard, CA, roughly two hours drive away from where I currently live. It is challenging to operate a manufacturing business in the USA, never mind Southern California, and I'm happy to see they've found some measure of success in the face of overseas competition.</p>
<p>Second, they have transparent pricing of their equipment listed on a <a href="https://www.haascnc.com/Configurator.html">web configuration tool</a>. No "contact your sales representative for a quote" runaround. I'm sure large customers can (and do) negotiate a discount, but at least there's a price up there on the screen to let people know what they should expect.</p>
<p>The third and most important thing that impressed me: they are friendly to customers who <a href="http://diy.haascnc.com">wish to work on their own machines</a>. Sure, they have the standard disclaimer "[work] should be done by authorized trained personnel" but they publish a lot of useful reference information for those who wish to forge ahead anyway. Most other machine tool companies do not publish this information. These non-DIY-friendly companies tell their customers to "contact your authorized service representative."</p>
<p>And lastly - Haas open their doors to customers (and potential customers) during <a href="http://www.haastec.com/">HaasTec</a>, their own open-house event. See the factory in action, see Haas machines building more Haas machines. That sounds like a Disneyland trip for machining geeks, sign me up!</body></html></p>
