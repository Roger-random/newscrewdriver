<p>The canonical introductory activity in microcontroller programming is to blink a LED. The <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/80627-badge-for-hackaday-conference-2018-in-belgrade">Hackaday Belgrade 2018 badge</a> makes this easy because there's already an LED on board. Actually three LEDs - a red, a green, and a blue inside a single integrated unit.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-17021 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/badge-rgb-led.jpg" alt="Badge RGB LED" width="624" height="492"></p>
<p>To make this even easier to access, this LED can be commanded from the onboard BASIC interpreter enhanced with badge-specific command <code>led</code>. It makes the LED blinking activity nearly trivial. This is a great way to get people started in a way that is as non-intimidating as possible</p>
<p>The custom <code>led</code> command in the BASIC interpreter is handled by the function <code>led_statement</code> inside <code><a href="https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/basic-badge/blob/master/firmware/badge1.X/src/basic/ubasic.c">ubasic.c</a></code>, which calls the function <code>set_led</code> inside <a href="https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/basic-badge/blob/master/firmware/badge1.X/src/hw.c"><code>hw.c</code>.</a> Custom user programs written in C can call <code>set_led</code> as well, or copy code from <code>set_led</code> to manipulate LED hardware directly. They set the state of several predefined PIC hardware pins. In <a href="https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/basic-badge/blob/master/firmware/badge1.X/src/hw.h"><code>hw.h</code></a>, we see the following</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>#define LED_R LATDbits.LATD6</code><br />
<code>#define LED_G LATFbits.LATF1</code><br />
<code>#define LED_B LATDbits.LATD7</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>These pins match up with what we see <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/80627/gallery#516d5bd730684b8318e2fa9119565b8f">on the schematic</a>, wired to three pins on the controller each in series with a current-limiting resistor and the corresponding LED.</p>
<p>So if someone wants to blink the LED on/off, they are all set. The infrastructure exists to do so from either BASIC or from C.</p>
<p>However, if they want to do something more sophisticated than just on or off - such as dimming, pulsing, or mixing the three LEDs to create custom colors, the existing infrastructure is not enough. In order to create a light intensity level somewhere between full on and full off, additional code will be required. The PIC is perfectly capable of creating this pulse-width modulated (PWM) activity on an output pin, it'd take just a bit of code, and should be one of the easier custom coding project to tackle.</body></html></p>
