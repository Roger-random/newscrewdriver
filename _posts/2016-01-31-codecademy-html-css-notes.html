<em>UPDATE: Codecademy has revamped their introductory "HTML &amp; CSS" class. The notes below reflect the old version which is no longer available.</em></p>
<p>Just finished the Codecademy "HTML &amp; CSS" class. It helps me get a feel of how Codecademy lessons are organized. There is a lot of overlap in material with the "Make a Website" class I finished earlier, but their structure is different.</p>
<p>"Make a Website" is focused on the goal of the AirBnB-like page they advertised up front, and the steps are laid out to reach that goal. While it starts with basic HTML concepts, it doesn't go into HTML areas not relevant to the goal. It's also happy to deviate from basic HTML in service of the goal, using the Bootstrap framework instead of getting mired in the complexities of handcrafting HTML layout.</p>
<p>"HTML &amp; CSS" is less focused on the goal (though it does have mini-goals in each of the units) and so has fuller coverage of basic concepts. On the CSS side, I liked the fact it gets into more gritty details of layout, but far short of what I can do with Bootstrap. There's still a sizable gap in my understanding before I can explain how Bootstrap does the layout magic it does with just CSS.</p>
<p>There's a lot more repetition in the "HTML &amp; CSS" class. Since it was mostly review for me, the repetition got very tiresome. I'll keep this in mind when we get into things new to me, perhaps I'll appreciate the repetition for new concepts.</body></html></p>
