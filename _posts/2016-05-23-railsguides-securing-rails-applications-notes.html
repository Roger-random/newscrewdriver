<p>As I enter the world of web development, I'm very wary of the security pitfalls of the domain. It is a completely different set of security threats than what I used to worry about. Different attack vectors that need to be defended against or mitigated with different techniques.</p>
<p>I had known about the <a href="https://www.owasp.org">Open Web Application Security Project</a> (OWASP) but I can't say I've reached proficiency understanding all the concepts there. At this point I can articulate most of the concepts listed in the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP Top 10</a> list. If I come across a description of an attack using one of these top 10 techniques, I can follow along with the description.</p>
<p>But that is far <strong>far</strong> short of the skill level where I can spot the security issues <em>ahead of time</em>. That is yet to come. With expectations set suitably low, I went through the <em><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">Securing Rails Applications</a></em> RailGuide to see how much I can understand. And surprisingly... quite a lot! Whoever wrote this guide was able to explain a lot of these issues in a way I can understand. I really appreciate the effort they put into breaking the problems down.</p>
<p>With every exploit, the guide also describes some mitigation for Rails applications. Not knowing a whole lot about Rails just yet, most of the mitigation descriptions made little sense. So while I understood more than I thought I would, I'd still have to come back again.</p>
<p>Right now I have no confidence that I can tell a secure Rails app from an insecure one. There's a whole lot of very clever people trying to find ways to break security boundaries. Whenever I read about an exploit, I usually end up shaking my head "I never would have thought to try that."</p>
<p>Since there's no way to guard against a problem you never thought of, I need to build up my web programming toolbox. I want to get from "I never would have thought to try that" to "ah, that's a clever thing to try" to "no problem, I'm pretty sure I've taken care of it."</p>
<p>One step at a time.</body></html></p>
