<p>Reading through CadQuery documentation, I'm getting into <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/05/05/cadquery-external-integration-potential/">topics like software integration</a>. While fascinating and full of possibilities, this is putting the cart before the horse. I don't know if CadQuery will be useful for my own projects. If I end up hating CadQuery, none of the rest would matter. Here are some foreseeable markers to help measure progress ramping up my CadQuery skills, and I'll find out how far I get.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">North Star</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The long term goal is for CadQuery (or whatever I decide to adopt) is to fulfill my wish list for <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/12/17/sawppy-dreams-of-collaborative-cad/">open-source collaborative CAD</a> which includes not just the CAD aspect but also integration into <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/04/sawppy-documentation-system-challenges/">project reference documentation</a>. I want to pick up my neglected <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/tag/micro-sawppy/">micro Sawppy project</a> with CadQuery plus associated tools, then roll what I've learned (both in the rover design itself, as well as CAD and documentation systems) to revamp standard size Sawppy into a significantly enhanced version 2.0. Even if everything goes perfectly (which it won't) I expect to take at least a year for this to unfold.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Starting Small</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since it would be foolhardy to jump into such a big project with a new platform, I will start small and tackle small 3D printing projects. Solve problems that can be solved with only a few pieces or just a single piece, before I increase complexity with multi-piece assemblies.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">External Dimensions</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My 3D printing objects are rarely standalone, they almost always fit onto something that already exists or tie multiple existing components together. Which means dealing with measurements of those existing objects, and I don't yet know how well I can handle that with a code CAD platform like CadQuery. This will be interesting to figure out on my own, as CadQuery documentation doesn't cover this topic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Documentation Updates</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When looking at somebody's GitHub repository, I appreciate having a picture to help tie the words and code and other pieces together. I do the same for my mature project repositories. I include a screen shot <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/compass">for a web app project</a>, and the same for a <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/kicad_tests/tree/main/lipo-bms-4056">reverse-engineered KiCad schematic</a>. The downside is keeping the image in sync with latest changes to the project. Instead of having to remember to go back and take another screen shot, I should be able to script CadQuery to automate image update.</p>

<li>Walk: Translate that to GitHub Actions to run automatically upon every new commit.</li>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I think it'll take a few months just to cover those beginner goals. If I make it that far (which I failed to do with FreeCAD) then I'll worry about picking some intermediate level goals.</p>
