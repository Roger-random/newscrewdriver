<p>If anybody wants to follow along and build their own Luggable PC Mark II, as of this writing <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-l24q-20-23-8-ips-led-hd-monitor-silver/5747424.p?skuId=5747424">Best Buy has the Lenovo L24q-20 monitor on sale again for $169.99</a>, a $30 discount (~15%) off the regular $199.99 price. I think this is part of the weekly deals so the price should be good through Saturday 8/26, 2017.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Price is back up to $199 as of 8/27, 2017. But since it's been discounted to $169.99 twice already within the past few months, I'm sure the sale will roll around again.</p>
