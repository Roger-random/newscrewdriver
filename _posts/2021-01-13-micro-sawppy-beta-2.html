<p>The main objective of MSB1 was to establish that a scaled-down rocker-bogie suspension system could nominally function and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/12/micro-sawppy-beta-1-kicking-up-its-middle-wheels/">expose problems along the way</a>. That objective did not require much of a rover body, so MSB1 only had a minimalist "Scarecrow" box. The main objective of MSB2 was to build upon its  established suspension system and add a body with some resemblance to Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance.</p>

<p>On top of that body is not a realistic model of a rover camera array. Instead, it has a smiling face, which follows the precedence set by rover illustration JPL used for Mars 2020 "Name the Rover" contest (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/06/mars-bound-rover-perseverance/" target="_blank">resulting in Perseverance</a>) and that of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/12/15/quick-look-esa-exomy-rover/" target="_blank">ESA's ExoMy rover</a>. I had contemplated various ideas on how the face can change, maybe small OLED panels or an e-ink display. For this first trial I just drew a face with black marker. (There was also a layer of cellophane tape to block marker ink from capillary action.) I did this during a virtual meet of makers and I was surprised that a simply drawn smiling face made a hugely positive difference on how people perceived my little rover project. Though I probably shouldn't be surprised: there was a similar change in perception when I <a href="https://twitter.com/SawppyRover/status/1121575509194788864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added googly eyes to Sawppy V1</a> after seeing it <a href="https://twitter.com/SawppyRover/status/1120825959123263489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">done by another Sawppy builder</a>. A tiny change makes people smile.</p>

<p>For electromechanical actuation, MSB2 used MG90S metal gear servos from a different manufacturer so I can compare how they perform against the ones used in MSB1. This particular batch were the MG90S that had a mild case of false advertising: only the final output gear was metal (visible as silvery metal) and the remainder were all black plastic. The two batches were bought from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3hAVTbd" target="_blank">same Amazon vendor on the same product page</a> (*) but they are obviously distinctly different products. One of the differences had a serious impact on MSB2 and changed the direction of the project, more details in a future post.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I originally intended for MSB2 to be up and running in time for launch of Perseverance rover, but as is usually the case, other things happened. All I could do was a short video where I manually moved MSB2's poseable arm waving a flag cheering Perseverance on. But it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/07/30/successful-launch-of-mars-bound-perseverance/" target="_blank">became a part of JPL's official launch tweet</a>, and I'm quite happy with that accomplishment even as I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/01/14/micro-sawppy-beta-2-steering/">work through MSB2 design problems</a>.</p>
