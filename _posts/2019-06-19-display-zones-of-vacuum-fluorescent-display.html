<p>Now that we have a set of states for <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/06/15/death-clock-display-states/">what to display</a> on our vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) we'll need to start dividing up the zones we'll <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/06/16/bit-operations-for-death-clock-display/">composite together</a> to create the display at any given point in time.</p>
<p>The easiest part are digits at the center: core functionality is to display a time of day on four digits and the colon at their center. We might do something non-digital with them in other animated states, but we know we'll show numbers appropriate for a time of day at some point.</p>
<p>To the left of those digits are the AM/PM elements, which will be part of time display. And as long as we're display a time of day, we know only one of those two will be illuminated. They will never be both illuminated, nor both dark.</p>
<p>Above them are the days of week, and we know we'll illuminate one and only one when showing our death prediction. Not more than one, and not zero.</p>
<p>Beyond these known zones, things get a little fuzzier. The ON/OFF elements are tentatively marked into their own zone, and the two rectangles above them in their own zone. The numbers 1 through 7 at the bottom will probably be their own zone, and finally off to the far right we have the "miscellaneous" section with OTR, CH, W, a clock face, and a dot. We have no plans to use any of them at the moment, but that could change.</p>
