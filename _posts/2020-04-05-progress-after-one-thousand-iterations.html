<p>Apparently I've got <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/04/one-thousand-posts/">a thousand posts under my belt</a>, so I thought it'd be fun to write down my current format. Sometime in the future I can look back on these notes and compare to see how it has evolved since.</p>
<p><strong>Length</strong>: My target length has remained 300 words, but I've become a lot less stringent about it. 300 words is enough for a beginning, middle and end to a story. It is also about the right length to describe a problem, list the constraints, and explain why I made the decision I did. Sometimes I could get my thoughts out in 250 words, and that's fine. When something goes long, I usually try to cut them into multiple ~300 word installments, but sometimes splitting up doesn't make sense. I forced it a few times and they read poorly in hindsight, so if I run into it again (like this post) I just let those pieces run long.</p>
<p><strong>Always Have A Featured Image</strong>: When I started writing I paid little attention to images, because the original focus is to have a written record I can search through. As it turned out, the featured image is really useful. First: it allows me to quickly skim through a set of posts just by their thumbnails, faster than reading each of their titles. Second: making sure I have at least one picture attached to every story is very helpful for jogging old memories. And sometimes, what I thought was a simple throwaway image became a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/05/02/prototype-vfd-driver-pcb-debugged/">useful wiring reference</a>. I now believe pictures are a valuable part of documenting. Today's cell phone cameras are so much better than they were four years ago, it only takes a few seconds to snap a high quality picture.</p>
<p><strong>Still figuring out video</strong>: While images may have been an afterthought, video was not a thought at all when I started. Right now I'm in the middle of exploring video as an supplement -- not a replacement -- for these written records. It is another tool to use when appropriate, and cell phone camera improvements helps on this front as well. The only hiccup today is that I can't directly embed video because VideoPress is only available to higher WordPress subscription tiers. As workarounds, short video clips <a href="https://twitter.com/Regorlas">are tweeted</a> then embedded, and longer video clips are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1uq4UNfPfjTp7MS7WtZZtg">uploaded to YouTube</a> and embedded. I expect video usage evolve rapidly as I experiment and see what works.</p>
<p><strong>Use more tags, fewer categories</strong>: I started out trying to organize posts in categories, and that has become an unsatisfying mess representing a lot of wasted effort. When I want to find something I wrote, I go for the straight text search instead of browsing categories. And if I want to relate posts to each other in a search, I can use tags. It has advantage of arbitrary relations free of constraints imposed by a tree hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Yet to stay with consistent voice</strong>: This is my blog about my own work, so I usually say "I". But sometimes I slip into talking about "we" because in my mind I'm talking to my future self.</p>
<p><strong>Keep up the daily rhythm</strong>: Scheduling a post to go out once a day, every day, is the best way I've had to keep the momentum going. I tried going to slower rhythms, like every other day, and it never works. If I stop for a single day, I'm liable to stop for multiple days that drag to weeks without a post. Usually there's a good reason like <a href="https://twitter.com/Regorlas/status/1217169845902442496?s=20">a paid project</a> that is consuming my time, but sometimes there isn't. I've learned it is very easy to lose my momentum.</p>
<p><strong>If it was interesting enough to take time, it's interesting enough to write</strong>: I now describe tasks that <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/06/06/installing-nvidia-gpu-accelerated-tensorflow-on-ubuntu-18-04-now-relatively-easier/">took time, multiple searches, and multiple tries, before I found the solution</a>. My original reasoning for not writing them down is the that since I found all the information online, my blog post won't have anything new that people can't find themselves. But there have been a few episodes where I forgot the solution and had to repeat the process again, and I was unhappy I didn't write it down earlier. I've learned my lesson. Now if it took a nontrivial amount of time, I'll at least jot down a few details in my "Drafts" folder for expanding to a full blog post later. Some of these are still sitting as a draft, but at least in that state they are still searchable.</p>
