<p>Yesterday I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/10/06/quest-for-the-whistler-button/">documented my quest to track down a button</a> I saw on a prop used in the movie <em>Sneakers</em> which premiered 28 years ago. Eventually learning that they were Omron B3J-2100s, and they are still <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/omron-electronics-inc-emc-div/B3J-2100/700006" target="_blank">available for purchase from Digi-Key</a>. Given the age of the movie, <em><strong>plus</strong></em> the fact this little detail was not important to the plot, <em><strong>plus</strong></em> the fact the rows of buttons were on screen for only roughly five seconds, I expected my blog post to quickly disappear into footnotes of the internet. Like everything else on this blog it was just a note from my personal explorations. Maybe it'll receive an occasional a visitor, here to learn how to get these buttons for themselves.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Judging by web traffic, I was quite mistaken. I knew that the movie made impressions on others like myself, but I underestimated how many of us were out there. And even more surprisingly, these buttons made an impression on people as well. I had no idea there were so many button connoisseurs out there whose appreciation for a switch goes beyond whether it can reliable close and open a circuit. My blog post and associated Tweet were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/10/07/the-quest-for-the-tactile-buttons-in-the-movie-sneakers-digikey-regorlas/" target="_blank">picked up by Adafruit blog</a> and someone even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24702444" target="_blank">submitted it to Hacker News</a> where it was as high as #13 for a brief time. Amazing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Its popularity also received feedback from many others. I found the prop in the movie was a Sequential Circuits <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://encyclotronic.com/synthesizers/sequential-circuits/prophet-2002-r469/" target="_blank">Prophet 2002</a>, but several people brought up the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808" target="_blank">Roland TR-808</a> and there was also a mention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberheim_OB-X">Oberheim OB-X</a>. They all used similar looking buttons for similar purposes: select options and an associated LED to indicates the active item. However, despite the similarity (and the TR-808 uses color to great effect) they are not the same Omron B3J buttons of a Prophet 2002.</p>

<p>I started posting a few corrections, but then I stopped. I realized that people were just sharing their own fond memories and there is no particular reason I have to point out they weren't Omron B3Js. If someone is fond of a stylish button, what's the point of taking away their joy? For the sake of pedantic correctness? Nah, we're all connoisseurs of our own favorites. They have theirs, and I have Omron B3J.</p>

<p>Thanks to [garrettlarson] on Hacker News, we have a link to a YouTube clip where we can see the Prophet 2002 and its row of Omron B3J-2100s. (Go to ~1:20 if embedded time offset isn't working.)</p>
