<p>I'm dipping my toes into playing with deep reinforcement learning via Unity's ML-Agents package. I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/24/notes-on-installing-unity-ml-agents-release-2/">made my first run</a> with the safest most mature option "Verified Package 1.0.8", which mapped to Release 2 by the ML-Agents repository versioning scheme. No problems were encountered during installation and I was able to run the 3D balancing ball project in the Getting Started guide. From there I could either explore Release 2 further or try a more adventurous release. I chose the latter and proceeded to install ML-Agents Release 18.</p>

<p>Doing this experiment on the same machine meant I had to keep the two installations separate. Unity Hub is already well-suited to keeping distinct versions isolated so they could run in parallel (<a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_18/Project/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unity 2019.4.25f1 for release 18</a>) though there's a potential point of conflict if Unity editors required different versions of Visual Studio Community Edition for editing code. On the Python side, <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a> is well suited to keep Python environments separate. Since files are referenced by directory, though, I cloned the ml-agents GitHub repository separately for each release instead trying to switch back and forth within the same directory.</p>

<p>I very much appreciated Unity for their project documentation, as my installation and Getting Started process went just as smoothly. I didn't expect to notice much different between release 2 and 18, but even just in installation and Getting Started I saw they've made changes. The biggest one that caught my eyes is that ml-agents switched from TensorFlow to PyTorch sometime during this time. There are other smaller changes, the most welcome one to me is a much more comprehensive collection of example configurations in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_18/config" target="_blank">the release_18 /config/ subdirectory</a>. Release 2 had only a handful of files, release 18 had a far larger directory tree to let people (like me) have more than one starting point.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure where to go from here, but given how well documented ml-agents appears to be, I thought it would be interesting to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/26/quick-look-at-ml-agents-development-history-part-1-up-to-version-1-0/">take a quick look back</a> to see where they've been.</p>
