<img class=" size-full wp-image-13341 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/qtlogo.png" alt="QtLogo" width="87" height="70">From a legal perspective, Qt is an interesting beast. There are two sets of licenses for application developers who wish to use Qt: a commercial license, or an open-source license. I'm sure this "<a href="https://www.qt.io/licensing/">dual-license</a>" approach is intended to let people have the best of both worlds. In practice, it means people who try to do their legal due diligence will have to wade through <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> of legal language. It's a very challenging barrier - most of the <a href="https://www.qt.io/faq/">Qt Frequently Asked Questions</a> page is devoted to licensing.</p>
<p>And that's the condensed version. The legal <a href="https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/">Terms and Conditions</a> section has multiple pages dedicated to different aspects of using Qt. As a non-lawyer, it's very hard to not let my eyes gloss over the thick language. Even if we just focus on just the open-source side of the licensing, there is an array of licenses to worry about. There are the strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a>Â , the more permissive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD licenses</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License">LGPL</a> that attempts to strike a balance between them. I didn't even know about LGPL until today. All of them are in play for various parts of Qt.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since my work so far is not for profit, and I intend to put everything up in public on Github, most of the terms of the open-source license should be easy to meet. I would definitely need to consult a lawyer before embarking on a commercial project, though.</p>
<p>With this basic due diligence complete, I went looking for the open-source edition of the Qt tools. They don't exactly make it easy to find on the official <a href="https://www.qt.io/download/">Qt downloads page</a>. It takes some persistence to navigate through the menu structures, looking for the de-emphasized texts and links, to find the download areas for the <a href="https://download.qt.io/official_releases">free open-source edition</a>.</p>
<p>Before I found that compiled binaries repository, I found the information to <a href="http://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git">build Qt5</a> and <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_Creator_from_Git">Qt Creator from source code</a>. It seemed to be confused by the Qt (both 4 and 5) that appeared to already exist on my Ubuntu installation and I never got the home-built Qt5 up and running. After I stumbled across the binaries repository, I decided to come back to building Qt5 from source after I've gained a bit more experience with Linux build systems.</body></html></p>
