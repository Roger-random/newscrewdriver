<p>I wanted to put CarPlay/Android Auto capability in my car, which is approaching twenty years old. The known solution displaces factory audio with a double-DIN bay for an aftermarket head unit. I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/31/going-off-the-beaten-metra-path/">decided against that path</a>, because I wanted to keep the factory audio head unit (and all its electronic and stylistic integrations) intact. Instead, I want to put that capability where the factory navigation system screen sat.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Mazda's factory navigation screen sits in a little motorized hood that retracts when not in use and keeps a screen close to a driver's field of view while in use. I liked that position and thought perhaps I could fit an aftermarket unit within that volume. It has enough width and height to match a double-DIN bay, but only a fraction of the depth. This is not a problem because we're not dealing with CDs or cassette tape mechanisms so modern head units can be very shallow. For example, <a href="https://amzn.to/3QkJjjD">this unit</a> (*) claims to be a mere 1.77 inches (probably designed for 40mm) deep. Possibly small enough to fit in the stock navigation hood. Another potential candidate is to buy <a href="https://amzn.to/3OB7UiK">a unit like this one</a> (*) that fits in a single-DIN bay and connects to an external screen. I could mount that screen in place of factory navigation screen and find some space nearby to mount the main body.</p>

<p>I knew these solutions are overkill, because they are full audio head units. Meaning they have their own speaker amplifiers, AM/FM tuners, and many other components that I don't really need because I'm keeping Mazda's stock audio head unit. I had searched for head units because I didn't know any better, but Amazon search algorithm helped me out: it started suggesting sale listings for standalone CarPlay/Android Auto receivers. I didn't know these things existed! But as soon as I understood they were available, I ignored the full audio head units. Standalone receivers are even shallower and, I hoped, more amenable to creative mounting schemes. Which of many offerings listed on Amazon would <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/02/carplay-and-android-auto-receiver-for-2004-mazda-rx-8/">be a good replacement</a> for a 2008 Mazda RX-8 navigation screen?</p>
