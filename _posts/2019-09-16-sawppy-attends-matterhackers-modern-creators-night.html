<a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/">MatterHackers</a> is a local supplier for 3D printing. They also carry other products catering to the same hobbyist-grade audience for small scale fabrication, such as laser cutters and CNC engravers. I've bought much of my supplies -- including the <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/petg-white-high-strength-filament-1.75mm/sk/M1VF5877">PETG filament</a> used to print the current iteration of Sawppy -- from MatterHackers.</p>
<p>I've met some of the people of MatterHackers at <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/07/sawppy-at-yuris-night-la-2019/">Yuri's Night</a>, and been extended an invitation to visit their headquarters where there's <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/showroom">a showroom area</a>. But I have yet to take them up on that invitations because, while MatterHackers is within driving distance, it is a nontrivial drive accounting for LA traffic. Going to that area is basically a day trip, and it kept not happening.</p>
<p>But when Sawppy was invited to be at their <em>Modern Creators Night </em>event, that was enough motivation for me to pack up and take that trip. At the event, I learned it is a scaled-up version of an occasional meetup MatterHackers used to hold at their main office, but there was no longer enough space there. Their business has grown, as has the size of the crowds. Hence - a new event at a venue with a new format.</p>
<p>Sawppy arrived and started roaming the exhibit area as rovers tend to do. But when it came time for the speakers to present, Sawppy was presented with a table for static exhibit. I made some signage I could tape to the table, to explain Sawppy when I'm not present to tell the story.</p>

<p>There were a lot of 3D prints on exhibit by other makers, and one of them decided to loan their little printed model of Curiosity to keep Sawppy company during speaker presentations. I was happily surprised when I saw this little guy, and didn't meet its owner until later. I regret to say I've already forgotten her name, but her generous and appropriate loan is very much appreciated!</p>
