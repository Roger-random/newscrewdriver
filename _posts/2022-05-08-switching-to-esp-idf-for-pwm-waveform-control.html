<p>I used ESPHome and Home Assistant to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/07/quick-esp32-pwm-experiment-via-esphome/">quickly experiment with parameters for ESP32 chip's LEDC peripheral</a> for generating PWM (pulse-width modulated) signals, seeing how they looked under a cheap oscilloscope. But for actually driving a segmented LCD, I will need even better control over signal behavior. It is an issue of timing: I need to toggle between high and low states for each common segment pin to generate an alternating signal, and I have two common segments to cycle through. In order to avoid flickering the LCD, this cycle needs to occur at least several tens of times a second.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The tightest control over timing I could get with ESPHome appears to be the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://esphome.io/components/esphome.html#on-loop" target="_blank"><code>on_loop</code> automation</a>, which is generally triggered roughly every 16 milliseconds. This translates to roughly 62Hz which, if I could complete the entire cycle, would be sufficient. But performing all of those toggles within a single <code>on_loop</code> would be too fast for our eyes to see, so we can only take one step in the cycle per <code>on_loop</code>. In order to toggle both high and low on consecutive <code>on_loop</code>, that cuts me down to 31Hz. Then there are two common segments, which cuts it further to 15Hz. I need something faster.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Until I have other tools in my toolbox, the "something faster" I have on hand require going to Espressif's ESP-IDF SDK. <a href="https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/frameworks/espidf.html">PlatformIO makes ESP-IDF easier to work with</a>, and I've had experience with this arena. My starting point (chosen because I've done similar things before) is to write a FreeRTOS task dedicated to toggling voltage levels by changing PWM parameters. In between steps of the cycle, I use a FreeRTOS wait (<code>vTaskDelay</code>) to send this task into the background until the next step. This mechanism allows finer control over timing than the ~16ms of <code>on_loop</code>, though it is only slightly better at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=12780" target="_blank">10ms by default</a>. Repeating the math above, that works out to 25Hz which would at least be as good as 24fps film. But that is not the limit. Once I'm working within ESP-IDF, I have the option to get even finer timing control. I can get a little bit faster by reconfiguring FreeRTOS tick rate via ESP-IDF's <code>menuconfig</code> tool. And for ultimate timing control I can start working with hardware timers.</p>

<p>I whipped up a test program to generate a staircase pattern. From 0% duty cycle, to 50% duty cycle, to 100%, then 50%, and repeat with 0%. Running at 20ms per step in the cycle, the timing looks solid. I can easily move this to 10ms and still have a solid square wave.</p>

<p>The 50% PWM value looked almost good enough without a capacitor. (Left) I have a huge pile of 300pF capacitors on hand, so I tried one and the waveform looked much better. (Right.) This is good enough for me to move forward with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/09/esp32-as-driver-for-simple-segmented-lcd/">wiring this signal into a segmented LCD</a>.</p>
