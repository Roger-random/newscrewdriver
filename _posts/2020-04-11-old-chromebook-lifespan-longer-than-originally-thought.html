<p>A cracked screen <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/05/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-first-pass-evaluation/">seemed to be the only problem</a> with this Toshiba Chromebook 2 (CB35-B3340). I found no other hardware or software issues with this machine and it seemed to be up and running well with an external monitor. The obvious solution was to buy a replacement screen module, but I was uncertain if that cost would be worthwhile. I based my opinion on Google's promise to support Chromebook hardware for five years, and it's been five years since this model was introduced. I didn't want to spend money on hardware that would be immediately obsolete.</p>
<p>I've since come across new information while exploring the device. This was the first Chrome OS device I was able to spend a significant time with, and I was curious about all the capabilities and limitations of this constrained-by-design operating system. While poking around in the Settings menu, under "About Chrome OS" I found the key quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>This device will get automatic software and security updates until September 2021.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't know how this September 2021 time was decided, but it is roughly seven years after the device was introduced. At a guess I would say Google estimated a two year shelf life for this particular Chromebook hardware to be sold, and the promised five year support clock didn't start until the end of that sales window. This would mean someone who bought this Chromebook just as it was discontinued would still get five years of support. If true, it is more generous than the typical hardware support policy.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, this support schedule changes the equation. If I bought a replacement screen module, this machine could return to full functionality and support for a year and a half. It could just be a normal Chromebook, or it could be a Chromebook running in developer mode to open up a gateway to more fun. With this increased motivation, I resumed my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/03/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-replacement-screen-shopping/">earlier shopping</a> for a replacement and this time <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/12/secondhand-replacement-screen-for-toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340/">bought a salvaged screen to install</a>.</body></html></p>
