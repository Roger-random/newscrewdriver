<p>I had taken <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/27/notes-on-ml-agents-development-history-part-2-version-1-0-to-present/">a quick look back</a> through evolution of Unity's ML-Agents from initial prerelease announcement to the present day. The features have been good, but looking at the dates highlighted a conspicuous gap: there have been no releases or announcements in the second half of 2021. This is notable because ML-Agents had been on a rapid releases schedule, with versions coming out every few weeks, since the original prerelease announcement. But things had come to a screeching halt -- why?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>[Update: <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/releases/tag/release_19">Release 19</a> became available on 2022/1/14, but I have yet to find information on why there was a long delay between 18 and 19.]</p>

<p>In the absence of official announcements, I went poking around through other publicly available information. The first resource was a brief look at the GitHub commit history for the ML-Agents repository. We've been warned the "main" branch can be unstable and I thought that meant it was the active development branch. This is apparently false, as I found hints of additional working branches that are out of public view. For example, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/commit/0de327ce93d16d5bb7b0bfbcbeec88cf06fdaba6" target="_blank">original commit for "Deterministic actions"</a> mentioned "release 19" even though the latest release is currently 18. These mentions of "release 19" had to be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/5637" target="_blank">removed as merge #5637</a>. In the description, it mentioned the branch "release_19_docs" which is not visible to us.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>With development progress partially obscured from view, I moved on to looking at currently open GitHub issues. When doing a first glance at an unfamiliar repository, I first look at the most recent items (the default view) and then I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acomments-desc" target="_blank">sort by "Most Commented"</a> to see the most popular items. Nothing caught my eye as a likely reason. However, it <em>did</em> eliminate the possibility that Unity had killed the project, because team members are still responding to issues. So that's comforting.</p>

<p>The next resource was to browse <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forum.unity.com/forums/ml-agents.453/" target="_blank">Unity Forum for ML-Agents</a>. Scrolling through issues between June and now, I saw multiple references to memory leaks. ("<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-ml-2-0-0-memory-leak.1141618/" target="_blank">Unity ML 2.0.0 Memory leak</a>" "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/trainning-is-more-and-more-slow.1143212/" target="_blank">Training is more and more slow</a>" "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/memory-leak-using-imitation-learning.1072415/" target="_blank">Memory leak using imitation learning</a>") Returning to issues list, I saw <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/5458" target="_blank">#5458 "Memory Leak"</a> is currently open for investigation. However, there's no comment one way or another if this bug (or another) is holding up release 19, so my quest came up empty-handed. However, I did get the idea if I run into a memory leak with release 18, I can try downgrading to release 17 to see that helps. Plus I came across a bunch of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/12/29/miscellaneous-gems-from-ml-agents-resources/">other interesting pieces of information</a>.</p>
