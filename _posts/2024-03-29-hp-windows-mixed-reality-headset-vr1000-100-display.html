<p>I'm taking apart my soon-to-be-bricked HP WMR headset. Mainly following the community contributed teardown guide on iFixit <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/03/28/hp-windows-mixed-reality-headset-vr1000-100-teardown/">plus my own detour into stuff like the headband</a>. My next detour is to take apart its display unit.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The iFixit community guide left it as a single unit, with good reason. I found out it is a slim lightweight assembly mostly held together with adhesive strips. (Double-sided tape) I'm not sure it is possible to disassemble it neatly. My disassembly was an irreversibly destructive procedure.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The display unit consists of two nearly identical assemblies, one for each eye. Given that fact I am grumpy they didn't design a way to adjust the distance between them to match an user's interpupillary distance. I had thought that limitation reflected a headset built on a single wide LCD a la Google Cardboard. But it wasn't! They were two separate square LCD units. Majority of wires lead to the actual liquid crystal matrix. The four-pin connector to the right lead to an LED strip for backlight.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I tried to disassemble the right eye assembly first, starting from the back. After releasing a metal frame fastened with six screws, I found everything else was taped down. Peeling this <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/24/amazon-fire-sr043kl-backlight-layers/">backlight diffuser assembly</a> broke the white plastic frame because that thin strip of tape was apparently stronger than the plastic.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After much snap-crackle-and-popping, the light diffusion films were removed and I could see the row of white backlight LEDs.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I managed to peel off the LED strip intact...</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But I completely destroyed the LCD matrix in doing so. That's a thin sliver of LCD stuck to the back, with its matrix circuitry visible. Ugh, what a mess.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For the other side, I decided to try approaching from the front. I first removed the Fresnel lens, which was held by its own ring of adhesive tape.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Carefully pushing from the front allowed me to remove this second screen assembly intact. That's better than before!</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But I still couldn't cleanly separate the LCD matrix from its backlight. Glass cracked, liquid smeared, plastic tore. It ended up just as big of a mess as the first try. Oh well.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hp-wmr-display-disassembled.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-42731"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I doubt I could line up the diffusion film with the LED strip again, so I failed to salvage two diffuse square white light sources. But the LED strips themselves might still be useful. They're good candidates for building a rig to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/10/16/side-lit-circuit-board-highlights-copper-traces/">side-illuminate small circuit boards</a>. These Fresnel lenses will join my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/27/phone-vr-headset-lenses/">salvaged Google Cardboard lenses</a> in my bin of parts awaiting potential future projects.</p>
