<p>It didn't take long before my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/09/02/old-drill-press-is-new-drill-press/">new old drill press</a> was put to work doing something that was difficult without the tool: I needed to drill a total of eight holes through three half inch diameter aluminum tubes, perpendicular to the tube's axis.</p>
<p>Because the surface is curved at the point where drilling starts, it takes a skilled hand to perform the task via freehand held drill and workpiece. I did not have such skills in my hands. Putting the workpiece in a vise helps, but still difficult for me to keep a hand held drill on center. What I needed was a way to hold both the workpiece and the drill bit in rigid relation to each other, meaning a custom workholding solution bolted to the drill press table.</p>

<p>It was built using a very cheapÂ <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/4-inch-jaw-capacity-drill-press-vise-30999.html">Harbor Freight vise</a>. Its jaws were removable and I designed and 3D printed replacement jaws with a V profile to better hold a round object. The other benefit of 3D printed plastic jaws compared to metal jaws is the reduced chance of marring workpiece surface.</p>

<p>The next step is to bolt this vise onto the drill press table. I saw mounting slots on both the table and the vise, and their slots were in the same pattern. I naively thought this was a standard form factor and they will easily line up.</p>
<p>When I put my vise on the table, I found that they did not.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19440" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/vise-and-drill-press-table-slots-do-not-align.jpg" alt="Vise and drill press table slots do not align" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>Fortunately even though they did not actually line up, they left enough room for me to use a smaller bolt to try to make things work. In this case, my stockpile of 1/4"-20 bolts.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19441" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/vise-and-table-has-room-for-quarter-inch-20.jpg" alt="Vise and table has room for quarter inch-20" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>The slots are too wide for the typical 1/4"-20 washers I had on hand for this bolt, but again I could turn to my 3D printer for custom solutions that help me bolt the vise to the drill press at the location I needed.</p>

<p>It took some adjustment to bolt the vise exactly where it needs to be. (Tip: double check to make sure the drill press table isn't itself moving!) But once everything was tightened down, the jig made drilling the holes I needed very simple.</p>
