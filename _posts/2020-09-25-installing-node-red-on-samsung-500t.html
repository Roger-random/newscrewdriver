<p>When I saw that Node-RED community contributions included a general battery state-of-charge reporting node, I thought that would be <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/24/node-red-challenge-round-1-battery-level-reporting/">a practical and useful first step</a> into playing with contribution nodes. I wanted to give that specific ndoe a try because given my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/03/samsung-500t-disappointments/" target="_blank">past miserable user experience</a> on my Samsung 500T tablet, I was not terribly motivated to put in the effort required to write my own code to extract battery information. But I'm willing to see if that Node-RED node can work its magic here, and the first step of is, obviously, see if we can even install Node-RED on the unloved machine.</p>

<p>There were many reasons to be pessimistic. Windows was and is still seen as a second-class citizen in many web-centric products. And not only is the tablet running Windows, it is stuck on an <strong><em>old </em></strong>version of Windows because of the whole <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/text-may-not-appear-in-the-windows-interface-on/ed1823d3-c82c-4d7f-ba9d-43ecbcf526e9" target="_blank">Intel Clover Trail mess</a> preventing modern Windows 10 support. Furthermore, Clover Trail is a 32-bit only chip without support for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/03/update-on-arm64-ros2-on-pi/" target="_blank"><code>x86-64</code> a.k.a. <code>amd64</code> instructions that are starting to become a requirement</a> on modern software frameworks. And it only has 1GB of RAM. And we're still dealing with that molasses-slow eMMC storage. The list goes on.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Fortunately Node.JS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">still has a 32-bit Windows installer</a>, though installation failed after nearly an hour of grinding away. I was first disappointed but then relieved to see it was "merely" a timeout installing one of the auxiliary components. This was not a huge surprise given how slow this machine is, so I waited for the system to settle down (lots of backlog waiting on that eMMC) before retrying. Node.JS installation succeeded the second time and after that I installed Node-RED without drama.</p>

<p>Launching Node-RED faced another unnecessary hurdle in the form of Windows Firewall. Annoyingly, this was one of the differences between Windows 1607 and modern builds, so I had none of the menu options I've become familiar with. But eventually I was able to let Node.JS open up a port to serve the Node-RED user interface, where I could install <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-battery" target="_blank">node-red-contrib-battery</a></code>.</p>

<p>I dropped three nodes into the blank flow: an inject node, a debug node, and the newly installed battery node between them. I hit "Deploy" and clicked to see if that battery node can extract any information and... it can! Not a lot, as most of the fields are blank or null, but it did return the current battery voltage and the charge percentage. This is all I need to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/09/26/monitoring-samsung-500t-discharge-charge-cycle/">observe this tablet's charge and discharge behavior</a>.</p>
