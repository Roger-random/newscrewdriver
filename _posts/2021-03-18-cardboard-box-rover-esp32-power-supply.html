<p>Power distribution is a concern in any electronics project, but <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/03/17/cardboard-box-rover-breadboard/">a breadboard ESP32 circuit</a> mounted on a cardboard box rover stand-in has an additional twist: USB. When a USB cable is plugged in to my ESP32 dev kit to upload new firmware and serial monitoring, it is also connected to the computer's +5V power rail. But when my rover is out and about on its own, that USB connection will be absent and ESP32 will have to draw power from the onboard battery.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I initially thought I would have to install a 5-volt regulator on my rover to power the ESP32, much as how I had been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/07/27/powering-the-raspberry-pi-3-with-mp1584-voltage-step-down-converter/" target="_blank">using MP1584 buck converters</a> to power Raspberry Pi 3 for earlier projects such as Sawppy V1. Then I remembered the ESP32 is a 3.3V part so there must already be a voltage regulator of some sort on the dev kit. Looking on the board and confirmed on the schematic, there is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.advanced-monolithic.com/pdf/ds1117.pdf" target="_blank">AMS1117</a>-3.3 LDO (low drop-out) regulator on duty. These regulators are happy to accept voltage up to 15V and down to as low as 1.3V over the output voltage, which in this case is 3.3 + 1.3 = 4.6V.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Looking over the schematic that HiLetgo bundled with this ESP32 dev kit, I see the onboard USB serial interface chip also runs on the 3.3V regulator output. Another thing this "Vin" pin is connected directly to is the power LED, which has a 1k current-limiting resistor so it can tolerate higher than 5V of input.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So that leaves the USB cable's +5V line. If I have battery power voltage on that VIN pin, I don't want that voltage to feed into my computer's USB port. I need to make sure this ESP32 can connect to USB or battery power but never both at the same time. My solution is to use a length of solid-core wire to bridge battery power input to the Vin pin, and shaping the wire so it blocks the USB port. This way, I can't connect this wire while the USB plug is in use.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In order to use USB power, I have to disconnect the VIN wire and swing it out of the way like a gate. In order to make sure that battery voltage wire doesn't touch anything inconvenient while it is out of the way, I stabbed the exposed solid core wire into cardboard to tie up that literal loose end.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>None of the remaining components on the rover testbed will need to receive software updates over USB, so this is the only place where I had to worry about switching between two power sources. Everything else will be <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/03/19/cardboard-rover-testbed-wheels-turning-and-steering/">wired directly to battery power</a>.</p>
