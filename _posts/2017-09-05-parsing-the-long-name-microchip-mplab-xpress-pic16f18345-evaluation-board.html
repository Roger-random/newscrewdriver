(Retail value: $12) While I had some vague ideas about PIC chips, I've never had the chance to sit down and play with one. Thanks to Hackaday LA, I now have my chance.</p>
<p>In my exploration of hardware projects, there have been occasional times when I thought: "Hmm, I wonder if this is the kind of problem I could solve with a PIC." Now that I have one to learn with, I hope to reach a point where I can definitively recognize problems that I can (or can't) solve with a PIC.</p>
<p>The first thing to figure out is what I actually have in my possession. The long name was more than a little intimidating but a little research parsed the name into the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Microchip</strong> in this context is not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor">generic meaning</a> but the proper name of the company <a href="http://www.microchip.com/">Microchip Technology</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>MPLAB</strong> is a <a href="http://www.microchip.com/mplab">product line</a> of software tools they produce. Offered to engineers for developing products around their hardware such as the PIC chips.</p>
<ul>
<li>MPLAB <strong>Xpress</strong> is a <a href="http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-xpress">specific product</a> in this line. It is a cloud-based variant of the full MPLAB software suite, scaled down to lower the barrier of entry into the world of PIC programming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>PIC16F18345</strong> is a cryptic alphanumeric string but that also makes it the least ambiguous one to understand. It designates a <a href="http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F18345">specific chip</a> from the extensive PIC product line.</li>
<li>
<strong>Evaluation</strong> means this is for prototyping and not for companies to put into large volume products. I won't understand why until later.</li>
<li>
<strong>Board</strong> means all of the above are mounted on a single circuit board.</li>
</ul>
<p>After decoding the individual words, my question was "Why is the name of their MPLAB Xpress <em>software</em> on this <em>hardware</em> device?"</p>
<p>The short answer: this evaluation board's on-board <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer_(hardware)">programmer </a>has been tailored to support MPLAB Xpress' cloud-based microcontroller development model.</p>
<p>The longer answer is coming up as tomorrow's post.</p>
