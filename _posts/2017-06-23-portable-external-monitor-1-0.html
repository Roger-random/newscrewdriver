<img class=" size-full wp-image-6679 alignnone" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lcd-enclosure-1-pieces.jpg" alt="LCD Enclosure 1 pieces" width="1024" height="491">Once the LCD panel and matching frame had been salvaged from the laptop, it's time to build an enclosure to hold it and the associated driver board together. Since this was only the first draft, I was not very aggressive about packing the components tightly. It's merely a simple big box to hold all the bits checking to see if I have all the mounting dimensions for all the circuit boards correct.</p>
<p>It was also the first time I had the chance to try acrylic sheets in a color other than clear. There was a dusty stack of 6 mm green acrylic that I enlisted into this project. Since this is just an early draft project, I valued ease of construction over appearance or strength (6 mm is more than sufficient) and so I used the interlocking tab design for self-aligning assembly.</p>
<p>The resulting box was functional, but not very interesting from a design viewpoint. I just wanted to prove that all the components worked together before I proceeded to the next draft.</p>
<p>I did not design this enclosure to stand by itself. Instead, I had designed this enclosure with a VESA standard 100x100mm mounting pattern in the back and intended to tap those laser-cut holes to take M5 fasteners. Once so prepared, I can mount this enclosure on any existing stand that conforms to the standard. That little design detail - independent of the LCD panel and driver board - sent me off on a little side exploration of plastic construction techniques.</p>
<p>That is a story for the next update.</body></html></p>
