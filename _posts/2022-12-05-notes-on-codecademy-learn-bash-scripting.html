<p>After a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/12/04/problems-with-codecademy-learn-sass-projects/">frustrating time with Codecademy's "Learn Sass" practice projects</a>, I poked around the course catalog for something quick and easy to go through. I saw the "<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/bash-scripting" target="_blank">Learn Bash Scripting</a></em>" course which had just a one-hour estimate for time commitment. Less than an hour later, I can say it met expectations: it was quick and easy covering a few basic things, leaving plenty more for me to learn on my own if I wanted to.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Technically speaking I've already been making shell scripts to automate a few repetitive tasks, but they have all just been lists of commands I would have typed at the command line. Maybe an <code>echo </code>or two to emit text, but no more. If I had needed to automate something that required decision-making logic, I used to go to something like Python. Which works but rather heavyweight if all I wanted was, say, a single <code>if</code> statement in reaction to a single user input. I could have done that with a shell script.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>And after taking this course, I know how. One of the first things we saw was <code>if/then/else/fi</code>. There is a limited set of logical operators available, along with warnings that spaces are consequential. (One extra space or one missing space become syntax errors.) Getting user input from a <code>read</code> is straightforward, though parsing the resulting string and error-handling weren't covered. We also got to see loop commands <code>for</code>, <code>until</code>, and <code>while</code>. What we did <em>not </em>cover in this course were how to define functions to be called elsewhere in the script in order to reduce repetition. That was the only thing I wished the course covered. If I wanted to do anything more sophisticated that the above, I would likely go to Python as I used to do.</p>

<p>The practice project associated with this course was touted as a "build script" but it's not a <code>makefile</code>, just a series of copy commands interspersed with a bit of logic. I was a little annoyed it assumed we knew <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_commands" target="_blank">command line tools</a> not covered in class, like <code>head</code> and <code>read</code>, but I've learned about them now and I could add them to my command-line toolbox.</p>
