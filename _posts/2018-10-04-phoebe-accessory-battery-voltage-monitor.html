<p>And now, a few notes on some optional accessories. These aren't required for anyone building their own Phoebe, but are nice to have.</p>
<p>The first item is a battery voltage meter <em>and alarm</em>. While Phoebe can monitor battery voltage in software via Roboclaw API, I also wanted an always-available physical readout of battery voltage. On <a href="http://sawppy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sawppy</a> I thought I just needed to show the battery's output voltage, but the number is only good if I could read it. During <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/05/08/rover-romping-at-jpl-first-public-appearance-of-sawppy-the-rover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sawppy's all-day outing at JPL</a>, California sunlight was too bright to read the number and I couldn't tell when my battery dropped below recommended level for lithium chemistry batteries.</p>
<p>Searching for a better solution, I found these <a href="https://amzn.to/2ncnqbf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battery voltage alarms</a>Â (*). Not only do they display voltage, when the level gets too low they also sound a buzzer. Judging by its product description, these were designed for remote-control aircraft where it's not convenient to read a small number up in the air.</p>
<p>The downside is that the alarm is designed to be audible while up in the air and buried inside a fuselage. When it is on the ground and right in front of my face, it is a piercing shriek. Which isn't so bad if it only occurs during low battery... but it also sounds a test beep when I first plug it in. It is loud. <em><strong>Very</strong> </em>loud. To save my eardrums, the alarm buzzer has been muffled with some cotton pulled from a cotton swab. It's still loud, but no longer gives me a headache afterwards.</p>
<p>I've also soldered a JST-XH connector onto the unpolarized input pins to fit my battery's balance charging plug. Having a polarized connector helps make sure I don't plug the battery in backwards. Those exposed pins are also a short-circuit risk, which I crudely mitigated by wrapping a layer of servo tape around them. Finally servo tape is used to secure the alarm to Phoebe's backbone.</p>
<p>Now I can drive Phoebe around the house, even out of sight, confident that if I ever run the battery too low I'll be notified with an alarm.</p>
