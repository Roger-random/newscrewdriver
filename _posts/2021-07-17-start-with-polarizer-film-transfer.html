<p>I've been interested in salvaging the polarizer film from a LCD panel but I've had problems removing the glue without destroying the film. I had the idea to leave the glue in place but transfer it to something else that is clear, like a sheet of acrylic. I wouldn't call <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/07/13/polarizer-film-transfer-experiment/">my first experiment</a> a success, but it was encouraging enough for me to start with the film for my next salvaged laptop LCD panel.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>There were two advantage I hoped to gain by pulling that sheet while the LCD module is still intact. First is physical strength, as the glass still has all of its reinforcements and I hope it will be less likely to break as I pull on the polarizer film. Second is thermal inertia, I've learned that a thin sheet of glass cools too quickly. By leaving the module intact I hoped it would stay hot longer.</p>

<p>The next LCD panel was salvaged from a Dell laptop whose model number I no longer remember. (Possibly a <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/vostro-3350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vostro 3350</a>?) It had a lovely bronze surface finish so I also kept the mounting frame for this panel.</p>

<p>Just like before, I left it out in the Southern California summer sun to soften the glue.</p>

<p>A ruler was used to give me a flat edge to hold against the glass, which along with keeping the module intact meant I didn't break this LCD glass during polarizer film removal.</p>

<p>And just my luck, the glue for this particular sheet isn't particularly tenacious and didn't want to stick to the acrylic. And where it did stick, it wasn't as optically clear as previous films.</p>

<p>A little bit of mineral spirits helped the glue settle against the acrylic. Still not optically clear, but I'm pleased with my progress on reducing surface imperfections.</p>
