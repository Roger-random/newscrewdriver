<p>The upside of choosing to learn a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/14/async-await-for-responsive-universal-windows-platform-applications/">Microsoft-backed technology</a> via their developer documentation site is that there'll be a lot of information. The downside is that it quickly becomes a flood of too much information, especially for things with a lot of surface area touching a lot of products. We end up with a section from each division, each introducing the concepts from their own perspectives. Resulting in a lot of redundant information though, thankfully in this case, I found nothing contradictory.</p>
<p>I started from the C# language side via the <code>async</code> keyword, which led me to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/async">quick conceptual overview</a> with a few short examples. Blitzing through this page got me oriented on the general direction, but it wasn't detailed enough for me to feel I understood. As a starting point it wasn't bad, but I needed to keep reading.</p>
<p>Next item I found was from the .NET side, and I was prepared for a long read with the title "<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/async-in-depth">Async in depth</a>". It was indeed more in depth than the previous page, but it was not quite as in depth as I had hoped. Still, it corrected a few misconceptions in my head, such as the fact async behavior does not necessarily mean multiple threads. In I/O bound operations, there may be no dedicated waiting thread at all. It meant in certain situations, this mechanism is better than old-school multithreaded techniques I had known. For example this avoids the situation of building up large numbers of threads sitting around blocked and waiting.</p>
<p>I got more details -- and more detailed code walkthroughs -- when I broadened my focus from the async keyword itself to TAP or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap">Task-based Asynchronous Pattern</a>, the umbrella under which Microsoft designated not just the async/await pattern itself but also a bunch of other related mechanisms. This section also has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/">a comparison of .NET asynchronous programming patterns</a>, and TAP <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/interop-with-other-asynchronous-patterns-and-types">can interoperate with them</a>. Which is not relevant to me personally but it's good to see Microsoft's habit for backwards compatibility is alive and well. This will be useful if I get into TAP and then something even newer and shinier comes along and I need to switch. I hope there aren't too many more of those, though, as the interop chart will get a lot more complicated and confusing very quickly.</p>
<p>These sections were informative, and I probably could have figured it out from there if I needed to get rolling on a short schedule. But I didn't have to. I had the luxury of time, and I found the gold mine that is the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/05/16/the-very-informative-c-programming-guide-for-asynchronous-programming/">C# Programming Guide for Asynchronous Programming</a>.</p>
