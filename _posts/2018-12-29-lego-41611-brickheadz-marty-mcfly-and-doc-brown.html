<p>Today will be a little holiday break from the usual fare... it's time to play with LEGO bricks!</p>
<p>I count <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls068786063/"><em>Back to the Future</em></a> as one of my favorite movie series, a fact known to most of my friends. So it's no surprise that I had been gifted a <em>Back to the Future</em> themed LEGO set. <a href="https://shop.lego.com/en-US/product/Marty-McFly-Doc-Brown-41611">Kit #41611</a> from their "<a href="https://shop.lego.com/en-US/category/brickheadz">BrickHeadz</a>" line of caricature figurines represented our stars Doc Brown and Marty McFly. This is my first BrickHeadz set and I was very curious to see how they would come together.</p>
<p>Our heroes are depicted as they were at the beginning of the first movie, when Doc demonstrated time machine operation for the first time in the parking lot of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WCETNFC3vjs"><del>Puente Hills</del></a> Twin Pines Mall. Marty is in his puffy 1985 jacket holding a VHS camcorder, and Doc is wearing his white lab coat with radiation symbol on the back and holding the car's remote control.</p>
<p>These kits minimize appearance of LEGO studs, using a lot of smooth pieces to create the desired appearance. This is especially apparent in the face and hair. Marty had many smoothly curved pieces, whereas Doc had a much more random jumble of pieces to represent his wild Einstein-like hair.</p>
<p>When I poured all the pieces out on the table, I wondered about a few pieces that were brightly colored in a way that did not match the color theme of the character. As I followed instructions, I learned these pieces would not be visible when properly assembled. Hence these oddly colored pieces were designed to be a visual indication if assembly should go wrong. Here's a partially complete Marty, the bright pink and bright green pieces sit inside the body and head, invisible when properly assembled.</p>

<p>Once Marty was complete, it was time for Doc. Again, the bright pink, yellow, and green pieces would not be visible when properly assembled.</p>

<p>And here is Doc and Marty, ready for their adventures through time. It's very generous of LEGO to give a few extra small pieces that are easy to lose. Assembling both of them consumed approximately 30-45 minutes, and I enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
