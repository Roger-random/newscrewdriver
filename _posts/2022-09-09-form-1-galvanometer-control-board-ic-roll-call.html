<p>This Form 1+ laser resin printer has <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/09/08/formlabs-form-1-next-steps/">a scorched galvanometer control board</a>, and replacements are no longer available from FormLabs. I don't have any background to make heads or tails of a laser galvanometer control board, but I might get a vague idea and learn something by examining its collection of components. Here's a roll call based on markings on those chips.</p>

<p>The board controls both X and Y axis galvanometers, probably why the middle section of this board a pair of identical assemblies.</p>

<p>Starting from the upper left, component U4 looks to be the brains of this operation: a ST Microelectronics <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f030k6.html" target="_blank">STM32F030K6T6</a> with its ARM Cortex-M0 core running at up to 48MHz.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>U5 in the upper right is an <a href="https://www.onsemi.com/products/power-management/linear-regulators-ldo/ncp1117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On Semiconductor NCP1117</a>, a low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator marked with 17-33G indicating it outputs 3.3V. This would supply power to the STM32 and other 3.3V digital logic.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Back towards the centerline, U6 is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/MCP4802" target="_blank">Microchip MCP4802 digital-to-analog converter</a> (DAC) with dual 8-bit resolution channels controlled via SPI.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Just below that is U7, a <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TL032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TI TL032</a> dual-channel op-amp.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On either side of U7 is a collection of 8 chips, four on each side. (U104, U105, U106, and U107 on the left. U204, U205, U206, and U207 on the right.) They are all marked with Microchip logo and 41H51103, which I found to be a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/mcp41hv51" target="_blank">MCP41HV51 SPI-controlled digital potentiometer</a>. In section 11.1 <em>Package Marking Information</em> of the MCP41HVx1 datasheet, 41H51103 is identified as MCP41HV51-103E/ST variant. </p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are a lot of surface mount passives in the center section with two copies of the layout left and right. Each copy gets a trio of chips marked with On Semiconductor logo and MC33274ADG. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.onsemi.com/products/signal-conditioning-control/amplifiers-comparators/operational-amplifiers-op-amps/mc33274a" target="_blank">These MC33274A chips</a> are each a quad-pack of op-amps. Each side has an additional component that is mounted vertically so we only see their top here.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Going back to an earlier picture focused on the burnt and melted connector, we can see one of those vertical standing components clearly on the right. They are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.onsemi.com/products/discrete-power-modules/general-purpose-and-low-vcesat-transistors/bd139" target="_blank">On Semiconductor BD139</a> NPN power transistors.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Three components are bolted to a heat sink at the bottom. To the left is a single <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ti.com/product/LM1876" target="_blank">Texas Instruments LM1876</a>. It is a dual 20W audio power amplifier. Adjacent to that amplifier are a mirror pair of ST Microelectronics voltage regulators. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.st.com/en/power-management/l79.html" target="_blank">The L79 <em>negative </em>voltage regulator</a> accept up to -35V DC and output a regulated -15V DC. <a href="https://www.st.com/en/power-management/l78.html">L78 is its symmetric positive voltage sibling</a>, accepts up to +35V DC and output a regulated +15V DC.</p>

<p>Those components are major pieces of my "how did this board work" puzzle, but I'm still fuzzy on how they fit together. If I want more data, I'll have to probe around while the system is powered up and I'm <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/09/10/considerations-exploring-formlabs-form-1-while-powered-up/">not entirely sure I want to do that</a>.</p>
