<p>I've been using my salvaged Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet control panel as test target hardware for learning CircuitPython. After <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/20/mx340-circuitpython-key-events/">exposing a keyboard event queue</a>, my first attempt at a CircuitPython library is now feature-complete. Well, it is on the software side. The hardware side still need help but I've recently learned it is a problem I can solve by spending money.</p>

<p>Up until this point, I had been exploring control panel communications by soldering wires to the back side of its FPC (flexible printed circuit) cable connector. This was essential because I still need the cable installed for main logic board and control panel to talk to each other. Now that I have a code library to let any CircuitPython microcontroller take the place of the main logic board, it means I can actually use my own cable and avoid the need to solder any more wires to these pins.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are vendors on Amazon selling breakout boards for popular FPC sizes, so I searched for 12-pin 1.0mm pitch FPC connector breakout to see my options. Some of these listings were for a bare circuit board, so <a href="https://amzn.to/4ezWnLG">I picked this one</a> (*) as it had the connector already soldered and its output pins were spaced out in a prototype board friendly 0.1"/2.54mm pitch format. Those output pins were also already numbered, which I wanted even though it made the next step a bit harder.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I then searched for a short piece of FPC I can use to connect my salvaged control panel with the breakout board. There were again multiple vendors offering 1.0mm pitch 12-position cables, with 150mm being a popular length. I just had to choose if I wanted "<a href="https://amzn.to/3RCNsz6">A-type</a>" (*) with metal contacts on the same side of the ribbon on both ends, or if I wanted "<a href="https://amzn.to/4eBswmc">B-type</a>" (*) with metal contacts on opposite sides of the ribbon. And here I got stuck. I didn't know which side the breakout board's connectors made their metal connections. If I chose wrong, I could flip the board over to make the connection, but that would mean the pin numbers would become reversed. That is a recipe for confusion and potentially project-killing mistakes. After waffling back and forth for a while, I decided on the solution of buying both sets. I felt spending a few extra dollars was worth the guarantee of consistent pin numbers.</p>

<p>Once the products arrived, a little probing indicated A-type was the correct answer for me to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/23/mx340-control-panel-under-rp2040-control/">wire up a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller</a> board.</p>
