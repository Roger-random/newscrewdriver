<p>I was happy to learn CadQuery selecters weren't limited to string descriptions, those strings were merely shorthand for a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/05/04/cadquery-selector-full-capability-via-code/">far more powerful (if verbose) Python syntax</a>. That should be fun to experiment with later. Another CadQuery feature on the long term experimentation list is its potential to be <a href="https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cqgi.html">integrated into other software workflows</a>. The default GUI <code>CQ-editor</code> is merely one example of what the team hopes will become an ecosystem of embedded CadQuery. We will see if those hopes pan out but I like where their thoughts are going.</p>

<p>The other example listed in CadQuery documentation is cq-directive. This allows CadQuery to work as a component in <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx documentation generation engine</a>. I need to examine this in more detail, because cq-directive or another tool like it can help me make progress towards a documentation system that solves the challenges I had on a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/11/04/sawppy-documentation-system-challenges/">documentation wish list</a>. Come to think of it, this is actually an area of overlap between that and my wish list for <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/12/17/sawppy-dreams-of-collaborative-cad/">collaborative open-source CAD solutions</a>. In theory CadQuery meets almost everything on that latter document, but I won't know more until I start working through some projects to get hands-on experience.</p>

<p>I expect that I will find a few features I like, but many other items in my wishlist will be missing. For a commercial package like Onshape that would simply be the end of the discussion. But with an open source CAD solution, technically speaking I could write my own implementation to patch these holes. Whether I find the motivation to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/05/06/cadquery-learning-curve-climbing-plan/">learn enough to actually do so</a> is a separate problem.</p>
