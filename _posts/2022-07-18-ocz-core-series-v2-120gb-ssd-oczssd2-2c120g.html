<p>My first SSD was a Patriot WARP V.2 32GB SSD. It not <em>quite </em>the bleeding edge, that "V.2" signified a revision that solved some issues in the first wave. Early experience with my first SSD was amazing enough for me to look for a larger 120GB unit to gain a little more elbow room in day-to-day use. They both represented early technology with flaws that needed solving before SSD became long-term reliable. I didn't know that when I bought them, but it was certainly made clear as their performance degraded over a few years and then dying entirely when they no longer showed up as SATA drives when plugged them in. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/17/patriot-warp-v-2-32gb-ssd-pe32gs25ssd/">I took apart the first Patriot drive</a>, now it's time for the second OCZ drive.</p>

<p>Since they were both built around the JMF602 controller and arrived on market around the same time, I expected them to both utilize a JMF602 reference design. Before I opened up this SSD, I expected the circuit board to look identical to the smaller Patriot, just with higher capacity flash memory chips.</p>

<p>I found I was wrong when I opened up the case, this drive used a very different circuit board layout. This design placed the JMF602 at the center, and I don't see an obvious debug header. There is still a connector adjacent to the SATA data port and it is populated on this drive: a USB mini-B socket that lets this SSD act as a USB flash drive.</p>

<p>Four more flash chips live on the other side of this board, again in a different layout compared to the Patriot drive. They seem to have the same production information sticker, but that might be some sort of industry standard sticker.</p>

<p>Thanks to the USB port, I could still access this drive even though the SATA port no longer enumerates. It is only an USB 2.0 connection, but I don't think that is a constraint. Write performance has degraded to an atrocious level on this drive. Here I'm copying a single large ISO file to the drive. 25MB/sec throughput and a response time of nearly 500ms are well below limits of USB2.</p>

<p>Read throughput is only slightly better at nearly 40MB/sec and a 20ms read response time is significantly faster but still not great. Since this drive still works via USB, for now I'll spare it the hot air treatment I performed to the Patriot. But given this level of performance I'm not sure if I can do anything useful with it.</p>
