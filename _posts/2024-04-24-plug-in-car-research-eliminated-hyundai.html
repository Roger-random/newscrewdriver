<p>My time with my 2004 Mazda RX-8 may be coming to an end given <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/20/less-enthusiasm-for-car-projects/">fading interest in doing my own work</a> and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/12/mazda-rx-8-compression-tested-low/">condition of its engine</a>. For now it has fresh coolant as part of recent radiator replacement. I also replaced the engine air filter and gave it an oil change. Brakes and tires both have plenty of life left, so that takes care of all minor wear and tear items. It is all set to ride until the next major event which will demand a big decision. To help inform that decision, I visited a nearby cluster of car dealerships. Going west to east on Gale Ave. in Puente Hills, CA, for an in-person look at various plug-in vehicles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toyota Prius Prime</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First stop was <a href="https://www.puentehillstoyota.com/">Puente Hills Toyota</a> to look at their new plug-in hybrid. I had leased a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/01/08/goodbye-chevy-volt-the-perfect-car-for-a-future-that-never-was/">Chevrolet Volt</a> from 2012-2015 and thought GM had the start of something good. Give it three generations of evolution and it should be a really compelling product. Sadly GM killed the Volt after just two generations, but Toyota continued developing their counterpart and <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/the-2023-toyota-prius-prime-is-a-champion-at-never-using-gas/">a new Prius Prime was recently released</a>. It is a hit! So much that Puente Hills Toyota allocation are sold before they even reach the lot. I could look at an already-sold Prius on the lot but none were available for a test drive. Toyota will make plenty, I'm sure, I just need to wait a bit for my hands-on time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chevrolet Bolt</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A block away was <a href="https://www.chevroletofpuentehills.com/">Chevrolet of Puente Hills</a>, with a red 2023 Chevrolet Bolt on the lot. Bolt production situation is opposite of the new Prius: Chevrolet shut down Bolt production late 2023 so dwindling inventory will not be replenished. I explained my situation to the employee who greeted me and asked for to take the Bolt around the block. The short drive was uneventful and mostly quiet, since I explained up front there will be no deal today.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I think the Bolt is a sufficient and capable compact car. It had much of the GM traits that I remember from my Volt, and it checks all the boxes for basic electric transportation. As a battery-only car it doesn't have the road trip gas-and-go capability of a Prius Prime, but I rarely take such trips so it's a tradeoff I'd consider making.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nissan Leaf</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.puentehillsnissan.com/">Puente Hills Nissan</a> was next door but I did not stop in. Leaf has toned down visual weirdness of earlier generations but still not a sight I'd enjoy walking up to. Nissan also decided against a liquid-cooled battery pack on cost and complexity grounds, an engineering decision that has been blamed for Leaf battery degradation faster than other EVs on the market. And finally, Nissan had bet on the wrong horse for high-speed charging. CHAdeMO lags far behind other alternatives in North America.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I took a brief look at Ariya, which addressed the battery cooling and charge plug challenges of a Leaf but it came across as a very generic vehicle with nothing that grabbed my attention as worth a price premium over a Bolt.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ford Mustang Mach-E</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Mach-E, in contrast, was more distinctive. I studied its styling for a few minutes on the lot of <a href="https://www.puentehillsford.com/">Puente Hills Ford</a> next door. I'm no Ford Mustang purist so Mach-E's mere existence did not offend me, but I decided its Mustang-inspired styling didn't attract me either. Still, I had little to lose by taking it for a spin around the block. Despite my clear up-front statement I would not be buying today, the representative made an earnest pitch. I appreciate his effort to make a case for my business. I found the Mach-E distinctive, but not in any way that enticed me to pay more over a Bolt.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hyundai IONIQ 5</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But the Hyundai IONIQ 5, now we're talking. It has a creased-edge retro-future style I find much more attractive than a Bolt. Though they're not really head-to-head competitors. The fact they both look like 5-door hatchbacks in pictures is a deception of proportions: Ioniq 5 wear 21" wheels in advertisements, the Bolt rolls on 17" wheels. So the car is bigger than I want, and those big tires promise big replacement bills to come, but I was willing pay a price premium for that styling.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I walked in to <a href="https://www.phhyundai.com/">Puente Hills Hyundai</a> and explained that I was researching potential cars and asked to take an IONIQ 5 around block. I was denied and told to come back when I'm serious about buying. This was quite jarring immediately following my experience at Ford! So I didn't get any data on how well I fit in the car, but I did get data on how Hyundai treat customers. That's enough to eliminate IONIQ 5 from consideration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Toyota Prius Prime is a sleek sedan that can drive mostly electric but can run on gas for road trips, built with Toyota quality for the long haul. Production is still ramping up.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Chevy Bolt has an overstyled busy exterior and economy class interior, but it should be a practical and economical box until/unless infamous GM quality rears its head. Inventory is running out.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Leaf, Ariya, and Mach-E failed to build a compelling case over a Bolt and/or Prius Prime.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hyundai IONIQ 5 <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/25/my-desired-hyundai-doesnt-exist-yet/">styling looks fantastic</a>, but given my dealership experience I will spend my money elsewhere.</p>
