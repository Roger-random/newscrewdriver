<p>I went on a reactive programming tangent thinking it would help me become an effective user of Angular web application framework. Because some very important parts of Angular made extensive use of a JavaScript reactive programming library called RxJS. I found a lot of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/13/notes-on-reactivex/">general information about reactive programming</a> out there, but I need to stay focused on Angular. Returning to Angular documentation, I picked another developer guide section to start reading: "<a href="https://angular.io/guide/http">HTTP client</a>". This page has a "Prerequisites" section at the top which linked to an "<a href="https://angular.io/guide/observables">Observables &amp; RxJS Guide</a>".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It was an introduction to reactive programming with the RxJS library, with examples that are relevant to Angular apps. I didn't know this guide existed. If I had, I would have started here first! If I had, I still wouldn't have understood RxJS immediately, but I would at least have a better focus as I ventured to other RxJS guides. Mostly thanks to <a href="https://angular.io/guide/observables-in-angular">Observables in Angular</a> which showed the most common RxJS usage patterns.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I was mildly disappointed the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/practical-observable-usage">Practical Usage</a> page had only two examples, and one of them was the type-ahead autocomplete mechanism already covered in Tour of Heroes. At least that one had a breakdown of how the asynchronous processing pipeline worked to accomplish its goal. The other example "<a href="https://angular.io/guide/practical-observable-usage#exponential-backoff">Exponential backoff</a>" had no such explanation. Just an overly optimistic claim "<em>With observables, it is very easy</em>" before we were tossed a chunk of code with no comments nor a breakdown of what it did. Definitely room for improvement here.</p>

<p>RxJS Observables were compared &amp; contrasted against JavaScript Promises in the "<a href="https://angular.io/guide/comparing-observables">Observables compared to other techniques</a>" section. I saw some unavoidable overlap with similar topics on other resources I recently read but still, it was a great way to help my brain think about how to make use of RxJS aligned with its strengths. But I know the best way to get comfortable with RxJS is to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/15/notes-on-angular-http-client-guide/">start working on code that use it</a>.</p>
