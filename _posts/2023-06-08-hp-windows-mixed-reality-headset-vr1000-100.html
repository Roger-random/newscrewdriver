<p>Disappointed by phone-based virtual reality systems, hampered by their limited 3DOF tracking, I committed to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/07/ditching-phone-based-virtual-reality-for-pc/">spending the money for a PC-based 6DOF system</a>. I didn't quite go all-in, though, because it was quite possible this headset would also end up just gathering dust. So instead of buying leading-edge hardware, I bought one of the first wave of Windows Mixed Reality headsets after they were discounted to compete with more advanced headsets that launched later. In my case this meant the HP Windows Mixed Reality headset model VR1000-100 and, thankfully, it did not end up just gathering dust. This 6DOF headset was far more enjoyable than lackluster 3DOF setups from <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/06/google-cardboard-and-friends/">Google Cardboard &amp; friends</a>.</p>

<p>This was around mid-2018, a few years after <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/05/my-virtual-reality-a-ha-moment/">my first experience</a> with a 6DOF PC setup that enchanted me. I eagerly anticipated seeing what a few years of hardware evolution had brought. The first and most immediately noticeable advancement is in display resolution. This headset specification lists 1440x1440 per eye, which multiplies out to double the number of pixels of an Oculus DK2. As expected, I saw the virtual world in much sharper detail. The "screen door effect" of black lines are present if I look for them, but not so thick as to be distracting and I could ignore them.</p>

<p>On the opposite end, the most immediately noticeable problem is frequent loss of tracking of handheld controllers. This headset has just two cameras for tracking, and it's pretty easy for my controller to move out of view of these two cameras. Newer headsets have four cameras to increase coverage volume. This older headset also lacked built-in audio speakers designed to maximize positional audio effects. It has a standard headphone jack and I plugged in <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/04/extracted-magnets-from-wired-earbuds/">some cheap earbuds</a>, but they don't work as well as purpose-built speakers.</p>

<p>One downside of a PC-based system is the fact there is a long tether to the computer somewhere nearby, restricting range of motion. I was able to extend the reach with a pair of ten-feet (~3 meter) cables: an <a href="https://amzn.to/43Km85O">HDMI extension cable</a> (*) and a <a href="https://amzn.to/43LEQKq">USB3 extension cable</a>. (*) I never noticed any problems that I attributed to these cables, and they let me move around more freely. But they are still cables in the real world, subject to tripping hazard and cord damage. (This would bite me later.)</p>

<p>Every Windows Mixed Reality headset seems to use a common reference design for their handheld controllers. I have been mostly happy with these, especially the wrist straps that saved the controllers from flying across the room on several occasions. They have proven to be very durable. Especially the illuminated LED halo for position tracking. Every once in a while, excited in my virtual world, I would enthusiastically wave and accidentally whack them against each other. In rare occasions, this would cause the controller to reset leading to a few seconds of "Oh no, did I break it?" panic.</p>

<p>One downside of these controllers is their power consumption. The power tray is shaped for standard AA batteries and rechargeable batteries are highly recommended. I tried a pair of non-rechargeable Alkaline AA batteries for curiosity's sake, and they died within twenty minutes of use. Due to their power consumption I have to recharge my NiMH AAs after every VR sesson, no matter if I use nice Eneloop batteries or <a href="https://amzn.to/3P1tCxe">cheap AmazonBasics batteries</a>.(*)</p>

<p>I used this headset enough to start wearing out the soft touch portions. After several years of on-and-off usage, the foam surround soaked up enough sweat to smell bad and fall apart. Since HP had discontinued support for this old headset, I had to buy <a href="https://vrcover.com/product/hp-mixed-reality-foam-replacement/">an aftermarket replacement from VR-Cover</a>.</p>

<p>Back to the topic of the cable tether: one engineering design decision that had worried me was the cable connector near my temple. If the cable should tangle up on something, it disconnects. I agree a disconnection is preferable to either yanking the headset off my head, or the laptop off my desk, or ripping the cable out of the HDMI port. But the connector is a nonstandard unidirectional type that is very finicky to plug back in and had very fine-pitched connectors. (I estimate 0.5mm pitch, on par with HDMI or DisplayPort connector but definitely not either of those types.) Such a dense connector with small contact points seems like a bad type to handle violent events like accidental cord jerks.</p>

<p>Eventually it happened: separating in response to an accidental yank, the connector suffered some kind of damage. I didn't look at it too carefully before plugging it back in. When I did, I felt and heard a crunch. "Oh, no. That can't be good." That ended the evening's VR session and the headset moved over to my electronics workbench <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/06/09/damaged-hp-windows-mixed-reality-headset-tether/">for a closer look</a>.</p>
