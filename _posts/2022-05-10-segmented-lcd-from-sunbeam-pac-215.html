<p>I now have <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/09/esp32-as-driver-for-simple-segmented-lcd/">imperfect but working control</a> of a 2-digit 7-segment LCD module salvaged from a Sunbeam PAC-215 electric blanket controller. I used an ESP32 for this initial run because I thought I needed voltage control over all ten pins. After a little bit of experimentation, I've found that I could probably get away with using 0V and 3.3V directly on each of the segment pins. For the common pins I need an additional option of the midway point 1.65V, but if it is true that an LCD uses very little current, perhaps I could supply that voltage with merely a voltage divider built from resistors? If true, I might be able to control this with something far simpler and less powerful than an ESP32. Perhaps an ATmega328 (Arduino)? Or a PIC16F18345, which has a DAC peripheral and already on hand. (If I'm going to buy a chip, I'll take Joey Castillo's suggestion and buy one with LCD control peripheral built in.) These are potential experiments for the future. For now, I want to wrap up work with this particular pair of salvaged LCDs which means leaving good notes for my future self.</p>

<p>I scribbled down this diagram when probing the pins. The pins were numbered before I knew what they did. Now that I know which are segment and which are common, I could label them differently.</p>

<p>I also moved to a zero-based counting system thinking it might be easier to match up to code. Color-coding the different common pins is an idea I picked up from Joey Castillo's slides, but I wonder if that's the best way to go. I can't claim to be an expert on how to use color in a way that's still accessible to the color blind, and coding common pin information in color risks losing data for scenarios like printing on a black-and-white laser printer.</p>

<p>Moving to letters for segments and numbers for common allows me to put them together as labels on each segment while reducing ambiguity. This is also friendlier to black-and-white printing, but it loses the visual delineation of color coding. Is this better? I don't know as I see strengths in each. I couldn't make up my mind on which to keep so I'll keep both of these diagrams here as references for later.</p>

<p>With this successful milestone of working with LCD modules, I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/05/11/segmented-lcd-from-taylor-food-thermometer/">revisited a module</a> that frustrated me earlier.</p>
