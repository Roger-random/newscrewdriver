<p>I had thought I was near the finish line for my backlight revival project, but then I tugged on one wire a little bit too hard and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/15/installing-arduino-circuit-caused-setback/">destroyed the circuit board test point I had soldered to</a>.</p>

<p>This is bad, and it got worse. As I tried to gently unwind this LED_EN wire, it was not gentle enough and the soldered points for V<sub>in</sub> and GND started unraveling as well. For those two wires I had soldered to either end of a (relatively) large surface mount decoupling capacitor bridging those two voltage planes, because the tops of these capacitors presented a metallic surface area for me to solder to. I had thought they were metal end pieces, but they were actually a thin layer of metal that I just learned would peel under stress. The good news was that I was able to melt the solder and remove those wires before they did any permanent damage, the bad news is that I'll need another approach for these connections as well.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since I've already proved to be clumsy with three out of four wires, I pulled out my hot glue gun to better secure my solder points starting with my PWM wire that still remains. I dropped a dollop of hot glue and, as I pulled my hot glue gun away, I felt the now-dreaded "pop" sensation in my fingertip holding the wire in place. I think I just lifted the PWM copper pad, too! Fortunately, my meter said I still had electrical continuity. So even if I <em>did </em>lift the pad, it is still connected, held in position by my drop of hot glue. But just in case I needed it, I probed around the board and managed to find a backup location for the PWM signal next to the main display control chip.</p>

<p>Backing up further, I found another test point to the left of the LED_EN test point I destroyed. It was labeled VLED and it was connected to the backlight supply voltage line. As fragile as these test points have proven to be, I think they're still better than the end of a surface mount capacitor. I'll use this one and hope I don't rip this one out as well. Finding a replacement location to solder to the ground plane was easy, as the entire circuit board shared a common ground plane and I had many choices for ground. Including the metal housing of the now-unused data connector that formerly connected to the rest of the laptop. So I'm not worried about a ground connection, I have a plan C, D, E, F, etc. For now I found what looks like a test data bus will use the ground pad for that.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Which leaves me with the original problem: the LED EN pad that I've destroyed. I had no luck finding another test point, and while I expect it is connected to one of the pins on the main LG Display ANX2804 chip, I couldn't find a good contact point for that either. Then I remembered the TPS61187 datasheet, where it said it was valid to connect EN to VDDIO which will cause the chip to be enabled whenever it receives power on V<sub>in</sub>. From my notes probing the components around the chip, I knew there were some surface mount components adjacent to each other. They are tiny, but I was able to get a short length of wire to solder across those two components. Since I won't be tugging on this wire, I should be OK here.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After I verified the VDDIO and EN pins are now connected, I realized there was another way: Since these two pins are adjacent to each other on the TPS61187 itself, a blob of solder can theoretically bridge those two pins right on the TPS61187. I'll keep that in mind as a potential plan C if I should need it.</p>

<p>To minimize the chances I'll need any of those backup-to-the-backup plans, I became very generous with my hot glue application. I sincerely hope I won't have to take this apart again, because I don't see how I can undo all this hot glue without destroying these solder points.</p>

<p>Fortunately I wouldn't have to undo anything because <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/17/installing-arduino-circuit-round-2/">my second attempt at system integration</a> was a success.</p>
