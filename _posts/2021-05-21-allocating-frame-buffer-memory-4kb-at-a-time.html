<p>Getting insight into computational processing workload was not absolutely critical for version 1.0.0 of my ESP_8_BIT_composite Arduino library. But now that the first release is done, it was very important to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/20/lightweight-performance-metrics-have-caveats/">get those tools up and running</a> for the development toolbox. Now that people have a handle on speed, I turned my attention to the other constraint: memory. An ESP32 application only has about 380KB to work with, and it takes about 61K to store a frame buffer for ESP_8_BIT. Adding double-buffering also doubled memory consumption, and I had actually half expected my second buffer allocation to fail. It didn't, so I got double-buffering done, but how close are we skating to the edge here?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fortunately I did not have to develop my own tools here to gain insight into memory allocation, ESP32 SDK already had one in the form of <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/heap_debug.html#heap-information" target="_blank">heap_caps_print_heap_info()</a></code> For my purposes, I called it with the <code>MALLOC_CAP_8BIT</code> flag because pixels are accessed at the single byte (8 bit) level. Here is the memory output running my test sketch, before I allocated the double buffers. I highlighted the blocks that are about to change in red:</p>

<p>I was surprised at how fragmented the memory space already was even before I started allocating memory in my own code. There are ten blocks of available memory, only two of which are large enough to accommodate an allocation for 60KB. Here is the memory picture after I allocated the two 60KB frame buffers (and two line arrays, one for each frame buffer.) With the changed sections highlighted in red.</p>

<p>The first big block, which previously had 122,968 bytes available, became the home of both 60KB buffers leaving only 56 bytes. That is a very tight fit! A smaller block, which previously had 5,872 bytes free, now had 3,920 bytes free indicating that's where the line arrays ended up. A little time with the calculator with these numbers arrived at 16 bytes of overhead per memory allocation.</p>

<p>This is good information to inform some decisions. I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/10/initial-issues-with-esp_8_bit-color-composite-video-out-library/" target="_blank">had originally planned</a> to give the developer a way to manage their own memory, but I changed my mind on that one just as I did for double buffering and performance metrics. In the interest of keeping API simple, I'll continue handling the allocation for typical usage and trust that advanced users know how to take my code and tailor it for their specific requirements.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ESP_8_BIT line array architecture allows us to split the raw frame buffer into smaller pieces. Not just a single 60KB allocation as I have done so far, it can accommodate any scheme all the way down to allocating 240 horizontal lines individually at 256 bytes each. That will allow us to make optimal use of small blocks of available memory. But doing 240 instead of 1 allocation for each of two buffers means 239 additional allocations * 16 bytes of overhead * 2 buffers = 7,648 extra bytes of overhead. That's too steep of a price for flexibility.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a compromise, I will allocate in the frame buffer in 4 kilobyte chunks. These will fit in seven out of ten available blocks of memory, an improvement from just two. Each frame would consist of 15 chunks. This works out to an extra 14 allocations * 16 bytes of overhead * 2 buffers = 448 bytes of overhead. This is a far more palatable price for flexibility. Here are the results with the frame buffers allocated in 4KB chunks, again with changed blocks in red:</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Instead of almost entirely consuming the block with 122,968 bytes leaving just 56 bytes, the two frame buffers are now distributed among smaller blocks leaving 28,329 contiguous bytes free in that big block. And we still have anther big block free with 113,792 bytes to accommodate large allocations.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Looking at this data, I could also see allocating in smaller chunks would have led to diminishing returns. Allocating in 2KB chunks would have doubled the overhead but not improved utilization. Dropping to 1KB would double the overhead again, and only open up one additional block of memory for use. Therefore allocating in 4KB chunks is indeed the best compromise, assuming my ESP32 memory map is representative of user scenarios. Satisfied with this arrangement, I proceeded to work on <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/22/til-some-video-equipment-support-both-pal-and-ntsc/">my first and last bug of version 1.0.0: PAL support</a>.</p>
