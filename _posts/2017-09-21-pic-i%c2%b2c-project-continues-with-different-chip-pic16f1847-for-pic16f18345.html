<p>My <a href="http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F18345">PIC16F18345</a> has stopped working properly as an I²C device. It could send data (I could read from it) but it could not receive (I could not write to it.) Debugging this behavior, I got as far as determining a flag on a status register is not being set correctly by the MSSP module. This is beyond my means to repair or work around in software. In the last post I described an ugly hack of a I²C protocol to let me get a little bit of work done, but what I really need is a new chip. I placed an order from <a href="http://www.microchipdirect.com/">Microchip Direct</a> and the replacements are on their way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I borrowed a PICkit 3 programmer and a tube of chips from Tux-Lab to see if I can continue working until my order arrived. The chip is <a href="http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F1847">PIC16F1847</a>, an older design with fewer features but in the same general family as the PIC16F18345 I've been learning. I could not load the exact same compiled code onto the chip, but the C code I wrote was fairly painless to migrate. The steps were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Created a new PIC16F1847 project in <a href="http://microchipdeveloper.com/mplabx:start">MPLAB X</a>.</li>
<li>Configured the chip for I²C communication in <a href="http://microchipdeveloper.com/mcc:start">MCC</a>.</li>
<li>Click "Generate" to create all the boilerplate code.</li>
<li>Copy the C code I wrote (not the generated boilerplate) from the PIC16F18345 project to the PIC16F1847 project.</li>
</ol>
<p>That compiled successfully right away, freeing me to make other changes. The pin layout of the PIC16F1847 pin is nothing like that for my existing board, so I had to set it up on a new breadboard. Since I'm rewiring anyway, I incorporated a different, brighter 7-segment LED display unit. This unit uses common anode pins to select the active digit each of which demand more current than a PIC can source. So I also incorporated some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N2222">2N2222</a> transistors to let the PIC control sourcing that current from the positive power rail instead of supplying that power itself.</p>
<p>The remaining key difference is that the PIC16F1847 is an 18-pin chip, where the PIC16F18345 is a 20-pin chip. Before, I had an extra pin unused, but now I'm one pin short for my project. I decided to temporarily sacrifice the decimal point until my 20-pin chip shipment arrives.</p>
<p>This is good enough to get me back up and running. Here's the setup displaying "1847"</p>
