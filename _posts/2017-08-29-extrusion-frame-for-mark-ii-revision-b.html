<p>Revision A of Luggable PC Mark II is a bare-bones skeleton that proved that all the components can more-or-less play nice together. It did not try to do anything beyond that, such as actually being a luggable chassis. That's the job of future revisions starting with revision B.</p>
<p>Up front and center is to find a way to attach a carrying handle. Rev A had two load-carrying extrusion beams sticking up straight through everything, which was easy to build but got in the way of packaging components around it. For rev. B I wanted to try routing all the structural extrusions around the outside of the enclosure.</p>
<p>When building Luggable PC Mark I I had designed the frame with all the extrusions precisely seated against each other. This turned out to be a mistake because it was very difficult to cut beams to exact lengths and also to have exactly squared-off ends. The edges of the extrusions are dependably precise: the same could not be said of the ends.</p>
<p>Applying that valuable lesson to Mark II meant that all the extrusion-to-extrusion contacts are edge-to-edge. The ends of the extrusions will either go into 3D printed plastic Â or just dangle into space. This way, minor error in length and squareness will not affect the overall design.</p>
<p>Misumi does not sell ready-made brackets to bolt <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300465870/">15mm HFS3 extrusions</a> together, so I designed and 3D-printed my own. Since I'm making my own custom designs anyway, it was easy to incorporate features I wanted in my own design. In the case of the exterior frame of rev. B, it meant shock-absorption bumpers for the corners of the frame.</p>
<p>PLA is not very flexible so the impact absorption will be minimal, but it was fun to build.</p>
