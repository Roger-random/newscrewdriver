<p>Prompted by <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/jpl_opensource_rover/in-progress-build-robot-garden-makerspace-t94.html">a question on the JPL Open Source Rover web forum</a>, I compiled all the 3D resources I had collected on Mars rover Curiosity. This reference data helped Sawppy match Curiosity's overall proportions and suspension geometry, which was my goal of making a mechanically faithful motorized model. I stopped there, but others rover builders like Laura McKeegan are working to improve accuracy in appearance so I thought I'd share these resources to help such efforts.</p>
<h2>3D web sites</h2>
<p>My starting point was JPL's official <a href="https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov">open source rover web site</a> whose opening animation has a 3D model of Curiosity cruising on a simulated Mars surface. I tried to extract that 3D mesh without success.</p>
<p>On a similar front, we could see a 3D model of Curiosity in the <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/curiosity/">"Experience Curiosity" web site</a>. It's possible this is using the exact same data set as the OSR, but again I'm not enough of a web developer to pull out the 3D data.</p>
<p>Finally we have a 3D model visible on <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/rover/">Curiosity's mission site</a>. Again it may or may not be the exact same one used in above two sites, but the difference here is that we have a "Download" button. Clicking that button results in a file named <code>Curiosity_static.glb</code>. My laptop running Windows 10 has a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/3d-viewer/9nblggh42ths">3D Viewer app</a> installed by default, which was able to view this file. I don't know what viewer software would be required for other platforms.</p>
<h2>3D printing</h2>
<p>A web search for "Curiosity 3D Model" and similar keywords would repeatedly lead me to a <a href="https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/mars-rover-curiosity">3D-printable static model</a>. Unfortunately, for my purposes this model is not useful. The geometry of this model were modified to be friendly to 3D printing and is not a faithful representation of Curiosity.</p>
<h2>3D animation</h2>
<p>However, on the same NASA 3D website, there are two Curiosity models for the free open source 3D animation program <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. As far as I can tell, these two models have the same 3D data but with different textures. "<a href="https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/curiosity-clean">Clean</a>" is factory fresh Curiosity, and "<a href="https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/curiosity-dirty">Dirty</a>" represents Curiosity after cruising on Mars for a while.</p>
<p>The advantage of these files is that suspension parts are separate elements that can be animated to show suspension articulation. I believe these files formed the basis for Gazebo simulation described in <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/jpl_opensource_rover/real-curiosity-rover-simulation-in-gazebo-with-ros-t60.html">this forum thread</a>. It also means we can split parts apart for a closer look. However, this file only has enough detail for animated graphics, it does not have enough detail for CNC machining: much of the surface detail are represented by bitmap textures instead of 3D mesh data.</p>
<p>While there is not enough detail for building a high fidelity model, these files were the best resource I had to measure component sizes and their relative layouts. I was able to bring them up in Blender, switch to orthographic projection view, and get images of Curiosity free of perspective distortion. In case that's useful to anyone, and you don't want to install &amp; run Blender just to obtain those images, here they are:</p>
