<p>After several years of not building anything original with my LEGO pieces, I finally had to admit to myself that <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/17/i-havent-used-lego-construction-in-years/">I'm not using LEGO as construction toys anymore</a>. Rather than letting them sit unused in neatly organized trays, I've decided to pull them out and rebuild them according to their respective instructions. This way at least I can still enjoy them in some form.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>LEGO pieces have a very distinct tactile sensation as they snap together, a sensation I associate with happy memories. It's what I treasure about LEGO, but not everyone feels the same. Some treat them as investment assets! Every LEGO kit is produced for some period of time, usually a few years, then discontinued. The finite supply imposes a scarcity and wherever there is scarcity, there is a market. Some time ago I learned there's an entire economy around people who buy and sell LEGO kits, and the highest value kits are those that were still sealed in original LEGO box and never opened.</p>

<p>Buying LEGO kits just to never assemble them? It is such a foreign concept to me, but I guess it can be lucrative. Take, for example, kit 10194 "Emerald Night". This LEGO train paid tribute to steam era locomotives that evoke a lot of nostalgic imagery. It launched in April 2009 for $99 USD. The BLS inflation calculator says that's roughly $142 in 2023 dollars, but this specific kit has vastly outpaced inflation. As of this writing, there are several eBay listings for unopened ("new in box") Emerald Night with asking price north of $1,000. Used sets in good condition (I think mine would qualify) are listed in the $500 ballpark. This is insane.</p>

<p>I don't remember details of buying this set. According to <a href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/set/10194-1/lego-trains-emerald-night">brickeconomy.com</a> it was available exclusively online via LEGO Shop@Home and not sold in stores. I guess that meant a limited production &amp; sales volume? Combined with the fact it builds out to a majestic looking steam engine, I can see why it would still be in high demand now. But I don't see my LEGO as investment assets, I got mine to build and play and make choo-choo noises with my mouth as it runs down the track. If I want investment assets, I will <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vfiax">buy some VFIAX</a>.</p>

<p>None of the parts in Emerald Knight jumped out at me as shapes unique to this kit. However, the locomotive exterior and its associated tender are in a deep rich dark green instead of the typical LEGO green color. Like WALL-E orange, I don't own any other LEGO pieces of this color, either. After disassembling the train many years ago, I've frequently eyed those dark green pieces and struggled to find another application for them. I never did. But now that I've put Emerald Night back together, I could admire this epic LEGO train again. Then I continued to reassemble all of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/19/my-other-lego-trains/">my other LEGO trains</a>.</p>
