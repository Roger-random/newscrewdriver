<p>I have solar lawn lights in my back yard that has failed after sitting in the harsh outdoor environment for several years. Their weakest point appear to be their NiMH batteries <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/07/29/solar-lawn-light-staying-with-nimh/">which I'm willing to replace</a>. But some of them also have failed solar cells or crumbling internal structure, and replacing a battery won't bring those back. I'll have to buy new replacements. I went online shopping for solar lawn lights and failed to find an exact match. I expected this but it was worth a few minutes to look. If I wanted to maintain a consistent appearance, I should have bought a second box at the time and stash it away.</p>

<p>As soon as I had that thought, an echo of memory came up in the back of my head. I went looking in the cabinet where I might keep such things and... yes! I had that same thought earlier, bought a second box, and forgot about it until now.</p>

<p>Putting an old sun-beaten unit next to a fresh one out of the box provided quite the contrast. Both in their painted metal surfaces and in the condition of their solar cells.</p>

<p>Here's a close-up view of a fresh solar cell. I now know the clear top section is not glass, but I don't know much else beyond that. Someone more knowledgeable about solar cell construction can probably look at this and foresee all the ways it will break down with age and exposure.</p>

<p>What I have now reflects real world long duration outdoor exposure. The clear top layer has yellowed and developed a rough surface texture. And I can't tell if the outer edges have eroded or if the clear layer material has shrunk. I don't know if the white visible patches are in the clear top material or in the solar cell underneath. I do know this solar cell stopped producing power some time back and will have to be <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/07/31/solar-lawn-light-functional-evaluation/">replaced by a new one</a>.</p>
