<p>I've learned a lot from taking apart my retired Canon Pixma MX340 multi-function inkjet, and there are many more potential lessons that I've chosen not to pursue. The <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/03/13/mx340-automatic-document-feeder-adf-disassembled/">paper-handling details of its ADF</a> is one, its main circuit board is another. There are a lot of electronics design lessons on this intricate board, but they're beyond my current skill level to understand. (In comparison, the control panel was a much simpler single-sided circuit board and I enjoyed <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/01/26/canon-pixma-mx340-control-panel-round-2-summary/">tracing through it</a>.) But I'll still take a cursory look at the main board.</p>

<p>So far, I've kept everything plugged in so I could keep it running and probe component interactions. Now I will unplug everything so I can take a look at the board itself. I took many pictures as reference as I went, to increase the odds I can put it back together, but I would later learn it was unnecessary.</p>

<p>Unplugging everything left a large plastic shield.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Removing the shield uncovered the fact that landline phone jacks (for its fax functionality) are on a separate circuit board. I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/05/19/input-jack-for-sawppy-wired-controller/">reused salvaged jacks</a> before so these may yet find another use.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finally I have the main board by itself. As already stated it's much more complex than my skill level can reverse-engineer, and I have no motivation to do so anyway.</p>

<p>The circuit board as a minimum of two layers, possibly more but I don't know enough to tell.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Apparently production volume of mainstream Canon inkjets are high enough to amortize up-front cost of custom electronic components. I picked a few large pieces and tried searching for them based on their markings, coming up empty handed across the board. An example is IC702 here marked with a Texas Instruments logo. It should have been a slam dunk but all I got were chip vendors promising to sell me a TI OACC3TTC 81024 without having any idea what it is. The same story repeated for three other chips before I threw my hands up and quit trying.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There were many unpopulated footprints on the main board, presumably to support features of other models in the product line. I can speculate on two of them. This looks like an Ethernet port, something I would have appreciated as its WiFi module is now out of date due to its WPS dependency.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This unpopulated footprint for connector CN502 is labeled "Card" and has nine pins, matching nine contacts on a SD card. MX340 have a feature for scanning a document directly to PDF file on a USB memory stick. Looks like a sibling model could write out to a SD card.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There were a few other unpopulated footprints but I had no speculation on what they might be. Bringing to a conclusion all I had expected to get out of looking over this circuit board. I plugged everything back in and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/03/15/mx340-disembodied-but-still-runs/">was mildly surprised it still ran.</a></p>
