<p>The last time I tried to learn PIC programming, I was frustrated by their developer support web site. There's a lot of detailed reference material for people who already know what they are doing and know what they are looking for. I didn't see anything like a tutorial for novices.</p>
<p>This time around Google helped me find a tutorial titled "<a href="http://microchipdeveloper.com/mcu1102:start">Get Started With The PIC16F1 Enhanced MCU Architecture</a>". Since the PIC on my evaluation board is the PIC16F18345 I thought that was a great place to start. When it came Â up on my web browser, I looked on the navigation bar on the left and felt stupid. The tutorial is under the big bold "Tutorial" section on the global navigation bar. Why didn't I see that before?</p>

<p>The answer? <em><strong>Because it was not there.</strong></em> If somebody just opens up the Microchip developer web site directly as I did before, without the URL taking me directly to a tutorial, the "Tutorial" section is absent from the navigation bar.</p>

<p>Most of the other sections are the same, but "Tutorial" is gone from below "Help" and instead there is "Store" above "Help". I guess Microchip is more eager to take my money than to teach me why I might want to give them money.</p>
<p>Why does Microchip mask the existence of the tutorials section? I don't know. I wish they hadn't, because I would have been able to get started on PIC programming much earlier.</p>
<p>Maybe they're ashamed of the quality of the tutorials? I hope not, because I'm about to dive in and I'd be sad if the tutorials sucked.</p>
