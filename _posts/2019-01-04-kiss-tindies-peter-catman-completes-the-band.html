<p>Fourth and final member of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/31/kiss-tindies-a-wire-form-practice-project/">KISS Tindie heads project</a> represents the Catman. Unlike <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/01/kiss-tindies-paul-starchild/">Starchild</a>, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/02/kiss-tindies-ace-spaceman/">Spaceman</a>, or <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/01/03/kiss-tindies-gene-demon/">Demon</a>, Catman is the drummer and has no guitar. This makes the figure itself easier as there's no axe to form. The only item of any complexity were his lapels, which required sharp bends that I couldn't quite make in copper wire. But it's all a simplified approximation anyway so.... hopefully good enough.</p>

<p>Soldering it together was a little tricky, but after I started using tape on Spaceman, my proficiency is now good enough for me to handle it as a problem I know how to solve.</p>

<p>With the chest details in place, the rest of the drummer were pretty simple.</p>

<p>In fact, too simple. I'm not happy with leaving the drummer standing up holding a pair of drumsticks... but more on that later. For now, I have taken the four KISS Tindie heads and, using existing reference artwork, given them simplified copper wire bodies. Here they are overlaid on top of my reference sheet.</p>

<p>And here they are without the reference art:</p>

<p>This was a fun project to trace out existing artwork using copper wire. But I'm not done yet. For starters, Catman the drummer needs a drum set.</p>
