<p>After Secure Boot discouraged me from putting a Linux variant on the recently revived <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/CA/content/support-product/5547?pn=NT.L4TAA.018">Acer SW5-012</a> (Aspire Switch 10) convertible laptop, I tried to replace the existing Windows 8 installation (locked with passwords I don't have) with the latest Windows 10.</p>
<p>The first thing to check is to look in the BIOS and verify the CPU is not a member of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/07/clover-trail-systems-wont-get-windows-10-creators-update-ever/">ill-fated Intel Clover Trail</a> series, whose support was dropped. Fortunately, the machine uses a newer CPU so I can try installing Windows 10 Fall Creator's Update. I had an installation USB flash drive built with Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Media Creation Tool</a>.</p>
<p>I needed an <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=9724">USB OTG cable</a> to <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/878637/how-to-boot-acer-aspire-switch-10-from-external-media">start the installation</a>. Once in progress, I deleted the existing Windows 8 system partition (~20 GB) and the recovery image partition (~7 GB), leaving the remaining two system partitions intact before proceeding.</p>
<p>When Windows 10 initially came up, there were significant problems with hardware support. The touchscreen didn't work, there was no sound, and the machine was ignorant of its own battery charge level. Fortunately all of these hardware issues were resolved by downloading and running the "Platform Drivers Installer" from <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/CA/content/support-product/5547?pn=NT.L4TAA.018">Acer's support site</a>.</p>
<p>After the driver situation was sorted out I started poking around elsewhere on the system and found a happy surprise on Windows licensing. Since I couldn't get into the Windows 8 installation, I couldn't perform a Windows upgrade. Because I performed a system wipe, I thought I lost the Windows license on this machine. But I was wrong! I don't know exactly what happened, but when I went to look at the computer's information, it claims "Windows is Activated."</p>
<p>The sticker on the bottom of the machine says it came with Windows 8 Pro. The new Windows 10 installation activated itself as Windows 10 Home. It is technically a step down from Pro to Home but I am not going to complain at the unexpectedly functional Windows license.</p>
<p>The machine outperformed my expectations. It handily outperformed my other computers with Intel Atom processors. I think the key part is its 2GB of RAM, double the 1GB RAM of the other Atom machines. The machine is surprisingly usable relative to its Atom peers.</p>
<p>Some credit is due to Acer for building a low-end computer in 2014 that is still capable on the software of 2017 (almost 2018.)</p>
<p>[UPDATE: <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/01/07/windows-10-can-activate-with-windows-8-hardware-key/">I figured out Windows 10 activates itself on Windows 8 machines</a>.]</p>
