<p>I bought a cheap wireless CarPlay/Android Auto receiver and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/04/first-impressions-of-carplay-and-android-auto-receiver-ttxscam-t86/">preliminary tests show it should work well</a> if I can install it in place of the factory navigation screen in my 2004 Mazda RX-8. This is not the type of procedure covered by Mazda's official workshop manual. I would need to check the RX-8 owner's forum at https://rx8club.com to see what others have done before me. One advantage of a twenty-year old car is twenty years of other people sharing their stories of tinkering with theirs.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I didn't find anybody doing the exact same thing. Perhaps standalone wireless receivers are too new for this DIY crowd? There were plenty of threads about CarPlay/Android Auto audio head units with the Metra kit, like <a href="https://www.rx8club.com/series-ii-interior-audio-electronics-167/2022-wireless-carplay-head-units-274072/">this relatively recent example</a>, but I've already <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/31/going-off-the-beaten-metra-path/">decided I'm not going that route</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The closest matches were from people who installed a 7" tablet in their factory navigation hood, as my new wireless receiver is basically a 7" tablet. I found several threads and many of them referenced one of these two pioneers: one project <a href="https://www.rx8club.com/series-i-interior-audio-electronics-24/samsung-galaxy-tablet-2-7-0-installed-navihood-completed-239266/">installing a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2</a>, and another project <a href="https://www.rx8club.com/series-i-interior-audio-electronics-24/my-car-tablet-237158/">installing a Huawei MediaPad</a>. Both of these were long threads with reference pictures and many good questions followed by valuable answers.</p>

<p>For connecting tablet audio to the car, later RX-8 came with an auxiliary audio input jack. Early RX-8 did not but this is a well-solved problem. People <a href="https://nikosapi.org/w/index.php/MazdaSpoof_-_A_Tape_Deck_Emulator">reverse engineered the audio head end circuit</a> so we can get an auxiliary audio port that the car believes to be the optional cassette tape deck or minidisc player modules. Implementations range from <a href="https://www.rx8club.com/new-member-forum-197/%2415-aux-solution-tape-md-button-262520/">an Arduino-based DIY solution</a> to commercial products for sale. I bought and installed a <a href="https://www.sylfex.com/products/AuxMod/">Sylfex AuxMod Basic</a> years ago, a product that has now been discontinued. Current-day alternatives include <a href="https://www.gtacarkits.com/product/mazda-rx8-2004-2008-iphone-aux-kit/">the GTA adapter kit</a>.</p>

<p>My wireless CarPlay/Android Auto receiver came bundled with a backup camera. I'm going to postpone that project until a future phase but, when I get around to it, there are forum threads I can reference as well <a href="https://www.rx8club.com/series-i-do-yourself-forum-73/diy-backup-camera-100883/">like this one</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Armed with knowledge, I opened up my toolbox and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/06/removing-navigation-lcd-assembly-from-2004-mazda-rx-8/">started dismantling my center console</a>.</p>
