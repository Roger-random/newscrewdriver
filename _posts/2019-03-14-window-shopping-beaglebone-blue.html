    This old LED light bulb dates back to the time when such dimmable units were $50
    each. Something is wrong with its power supply. We couldn&#39;t figure out which
    specific component failed, but we had a lot of fun trying. <a href="https://t.co/7zX1D8Vsm7">pic.twitter.com/7zX1D8Vsm7</a></p>&mdash;

<p>Sawppy was a great ice breaker as I roamed through the expo hall of SCaLE 17x. It was certainly the right audience to appreciate such a project, even though there were few companies with products directly relevant to a hobbyist Mars rover. One notable exception, however is the <a href="https://beagleboard.org/about">BeagleBoard Foundation</a> booth. As Sawppy drove by, the reception was: "Is that a Raspberry Pi? Yes it is. That should be a <a href="https://beagleboard.org/blue">BeagleBone Blue</a>!"</p>

<p>With this prompt, I looked into BBBlue in more detail. At $80 it is significantly more expensive than a bare Raspberry Pi, but it incorporates a lot of robotics-related features that a Pi would require several HATs to reach parity.</p>
<p>All BeagleBoards offer a few advantages over a Raspberry Pi, which the BBBlue inherits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated flash storage, Pi requires a separate microSD card.</li>
<li>Onboard LEDs for diagnosis information.</li>
<li>Onboard buttons for user interaction - including a power button! It's always personally grated me a Raspberry Pi has no graceful shutdown button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above and beyond standard BeagleBoards, the Blue adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>A voltage regulator, which I know well is <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2017/07/27/powering-the-raspberry-pi-3-with-mp1584-voltage-step-down-converter/">an extra component</a> on a Pi.</li>
<li>On top of that, BBBlue can also handle charging a 2S LiPo battery! Being able to leave the battery inside a robot would be a huge convenience. And people who don't own smart battery chargers wouldn't need to buy one if all they do is use their battery with a BBBlue.</li>
<li>8 PWM headers for RC-style servo motors.</li>
<li>4 H-bridge to control 4 DC motors.</li>
<li>4 Quadrature encoder inputs to know what those motors are up to.</li>
<li>9-axis IMU (XYZ accelaration + XYZ rotation)</li>
<li>Barometer</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, a BBBlue is not a great fit for Sawppy because it uses <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/07/05/wrangling-rc-servos-becoming-a-hassle-try-serial-bus-servos/">serial bus servos</a> making all the hardware control features (8 PWM header, 4 motor control, 4 quadrature input) redundant. But I can definitely think of a few projects that would make good use of a BeagleBone Blue. It is promising enough for me to order one to play with.</body></html></p>
