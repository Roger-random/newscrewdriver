<p>After <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/21/notes-after-xbox-one-x-ssd-upgrade/">wrapping up my adventures in Xbox One SSD upgrades</a>, I decided to stay on the theme of storage devices and dug up this old thing from my pile of hardware awaiting teardown.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fantom-drives-fdu80-top.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-35309"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This device looks ancient but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fantomdrives.com/" target="_blank">Fantom Drives appears to be still around today</a>. Or possibly a company has acquired rights to that name and logo for doing business. The website lists a few internal M.2 SSDs but most of the product line are external USB storage drives. This is likely an early product of that line.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fantom-drives-fdu80-front.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-35311"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Size of this enclosure is consistent with a single 5.25" floppy (or CD-ROM or DVD) drive bay. However, the front faceplate is empty with no slot for a disk.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":35313,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fantom-drives-fdu80-back.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-35313"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Around the back we see a plug (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320#C13/C14_coupler" target="_blank">IEC 60320 C13/C14</a>) for power and a USB plug (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#Standard_connectors" target="_blank">type B</a>) for data. A power switch and cooling fan rounds out the plate. I found the fan curious, because I don't see any grille for intake or exhaust on this enclosure. Airflow would have been limited at best.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I see four screws on this plate. Two of them holds the fan in place, and the other two probably holds the USB data translation system in place. Neither look like a way for me to open up the box.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fantom-drives-fdu80-bottom.jpg?w=576" alt="" class="wp-image-35315"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Four screws are visible on the bottom, and again they don't look like something that'll let me open the enclosure. They probably hold the storage device within.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fantom-drives-fdu80-warranty-seal.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-35317"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm sure the warranty is long gone on this device, but I'm thankful for this "Warranty Void if This Seal is Broken" sticker because they would have placed it in a location critical to disassembly. Which is where I should start.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":35305,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fantom-drives-fdu80-top-removed.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-35305"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After the sticker was removed, the dark plastic clips on either side could be removed, allowing top and bottom enclosure halves to separate. Inside the enclosure we see... a standard 3.5" hard disk drive looking pretty small inside that enclosure. It has a capacity of 80GB, giving an idea of how old this thing is. Nowadays we can buy cheap microSD cards with more capacity.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fantom-drives-fdu80-pata-drive.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-35319"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another hint of its age is the antiquated <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA" target="_blank">parallel ATA interface</a> used by this drive. I remember working on old PCs, fighting these huge and unwieldy cables. I do not miss them. Modern <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA" target="_blank">SATA (serial ATA)</a> is so much easier to work with.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fantom-drives-fdu80-hdd-motor-4-wire.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-35321"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The spindle motor on this hard drive caught my attention: it is connected with four wires and not three like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/04/27/hard-drive-brushless-motor-as-generator/" target="_blank">the hard drive motor I tried to turn into a generator</a>. Could this be a pair of windings for two independent sets of coils? If so, I might try to run this thing using a stepper motor driver just to see what happens.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As for the electronics, I don't know if I will ever find use for a board that translates between USB2 and PATA, two old and slow interfaces. The power supply is more likely to find reuse. I have a sizable stockpile of wall warts including several units with 12V DC output and several with 5V DC output. However, this particular power supply might come in handy if I ever need 12V <em><strong>and</strong></em> 5V together.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But back to that four-wire motor: <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/23/hard-drive-wd800-motor-control-on-oscilloscope/">what's going on over those wires</a>?</p>
