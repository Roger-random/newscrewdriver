<p>I love taking things apart, and it's an extra bonus if I can take something apart without destroying it. And to do that, it's useful to have information about the innards before applying tools. Manufacturers aren't in the habit of providing free information for what they refer to as the "non user serviceable parts inside." However, if they want to legally sell a device that involves wireless communication, they have to submit certain information to regulatory authorities. In the United States, this is the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and every wireless device is required to have a FCC ID and submit information to be filed with that ID.</p>
<p>The information presented are tailored for FCC purposes, but they are also useful for the curious consumer who want to take apart what they've bought. Breakdown of exterior components are common, as are pictures of disassembled device's interior. It's one of the many resources I consulted for my recent Hackaday how-to writeup describing <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/02/04/how-to-hack-a-portable-bluetooth-speaker-by-skipping-the-bluetooth/">how to repurpose a portable Bluetooth speaker for fun electronics projects</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the web site <a href="https://fccid.io/">FCC ID.io</a> is not run by the government agency otherwise I assume the domain would have been under <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">fcc.gov</a> which it is not. I couldn't find an "About Us" page describing why the site exists, but it is a simple straightforward bare bones site. Full of useful information and lacking in useless fancy eye candy and also lacking in annoying ads. I don't know how the site owners make money to support the site, but I hope it is working out for them and I appreciate having this resource available.</p>
