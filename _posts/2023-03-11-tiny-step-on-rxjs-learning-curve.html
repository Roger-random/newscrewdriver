<p>I learned a lot from reading <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/10/notes-on-angular-developer-guide-to-testing/">Angular's Developer Guide to Testing</a>, one of which is that I have a significant weak spot in my Angular understanding: how and when to use RxJS for asynchronous operations. Not just for testing, but also for writing Angular application code. On my first run through "Tour of Heroes" tutorial, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/10/20/notes-on-tour-of-heroes-tutorial-4-adding-services/">RxJS was a black box I didn't understand</a> at all. On my second run, I understood the tutorial enough to understand specific uses of RxJS from context, but my understanding did not extend to the rest of that library. I certainly don't know how to employ RxJS for my own tasks. It's time to buckle down and <a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview">read official RxJS documentation</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>This was quite a chore. It appears RxJS official documentation was written by its development team for an audience that already knows what it does and why they would want it. It started with "<em>RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences</em>" and jargon gets thicker from there. (Interspersed with words like "just" and "simply" which this beginner found ridiculous.) There was no "Getting Started" section. The next-best candidate section "Installation" is full of material telling existing users how to migrate breaking changes, not an introduction to new users.</p>

<p>The good news is that, as of this writing, RxJS is still <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs">under active development</a>. Today's stable release 7.8.0 has a timestamp only a few weeks old. (December 15th, 2022.) I was concerned about that, because RxJS was a solution for JavaScript asynchronous programming before JavaScript evolved to have its own asynchronous constructs like async/await. It doesn't map cleanly to Promises and <a href="https://rxjs.dev/deprecations/to-promise">conversion is a bit of a mess</a>. But RxJS still <a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable#pull-versus-push">does things that standard JavaScript doesn't do</a>, so there are still scenarios where RxJS would be the right tool for the job. It'll take more learning before I recognize those scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Observable</strong>: RxJS foundation class. One thing that demystified a lot was rewriting an analogy using plain JavaScript. Seeing something familiar and understandable (with my very recent JavaScript education) gave me a starting point to try understanding the rest of the page. Unhelpfully this was <a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable#disposing-observable-executions">at the bottom of the page</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Observer</strong>: It took a while for me to understand observer where <em>my </em>code fits into the system and I can use as little or as much of it as I need for a scenario. It can be a single callback for receiving data ("next") but I can also register optional callbacks to be notified of problems ("error") or when there's no more data ("complete").</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong>: Documentation said this is the powerful part of RxJS, but didn't really explain why or how we would leverage that power. This is also where <a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/operators#marble-diagrams">marble diagrams were explained</a>, something that bewildered me when Angular testing discussed marble testing. The overview of available operators is a disappointing list of just names. Each name is a link to their reference page without any additional context. I'd have to click the link and read each one. I would love a reference where each link has an 1-2 sentence summary, but no luck here.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: These are Observable that multicasts to more than one Observer. Up until this point I hadn't known a basic Observable only broadcast to a single Observer! This critical information should have been covered earlier.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Scheduler</strong>: No usage examples or scenarios were given so I have no idea when I should care about choosing a different RxJS scheduler. I see the "How to do X", but not "Why you want to do X."</p>

<p>I'm sure everything in official RxJS documentation is technically correct but the information lacks context. Or more precisely, I don't think they were even trying to provide context for readers who are unaware. Perhaps there are resources to help RxJS beginners <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/03/12/notes-on-learn-rxjs/">elsewhere on the internet</a>?</p>
