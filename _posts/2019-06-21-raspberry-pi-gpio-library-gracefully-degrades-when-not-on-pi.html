<p>Our <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/17/assembling-prototype-vfd-driver-pcb/">custom drive board</a> for our <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/04/02/sleuthing-nec-vsl0010-a-vfd-control-pinout/">vacuum fluorescent display</a> (VFD) is built around a PIC which accepts commands via I2C. We tested this setup using a Raspberry Pi and we plan to continue doing so in the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/06/12/vfd-project-the-death-clock/">Death Clock project</a>. An easy way to perform I2C communication on Raspberry Pi is the <a href="http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/"><code>pigpio</code> library</a> which was what our test programs have used so far.</p>
<p>While Emily continues working on hardware work items, I wanted to get started on Death Clock software. But it does mean I'd have to work on software in absence of the actual hardware. This isn't a big problem, because the <code>pigpio</code> library degrades gracefully when not running on a Pi. So it'll be easy for my program to switch between two modes: one when running on the Pi with the driver board, and one without.</p>
<p>The key is the pigpio library's feature to remotely communicate with a Pi.Â The module that actually interfaces with Pi hardware is called the <a href="http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html"><code>pigpio</code> daemon</a>, and it can be configured to accept commands from the local network, which may or may not be generated by another Pi. Which is why the <code>pigpio</code> library could be installed and imported on a non-Pi like my desktop.</p>

<p>For development purposes, then, I could act as if my desktop wants to communicate with a pigpio daemon over the network and, when it fails to connect, fall back to the mode without a Pi. In practice this means trying to open a Pi's GPIO pins by calling <code>pigpio.pi()</code> and then checking its <code>connected</code> property. If true, we are running on a Pi. And if not, we go with the fallback path.</p>
<p>This is a very straightforward and graceful fallback to make it simple for me to develop Death Clock code on my desktop machine without our actual VFD hardware. I can get the basic logic up and running, though I won't know how it will actually look. I might be able to rig up something to visualize my results, but basic logic comes first.</p>
<p>Code discussed in this blog post <a href="https://github.com/Roger-random/vfd_on_pic/blob/master/pi_test/deathclock.py">are visible on Github</a>.</p>
