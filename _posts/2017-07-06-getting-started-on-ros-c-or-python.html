<img class=" size-full wp-image-7463 alignleft" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rosorg-logo1.png" alt="rosorg-logo1" width="254" height="73">One of the items on my longtime to-do list is to investigate at least one of the publicly available robotics frameworks. Every robot project I've participated in so far has been a ground-up affair, everything built from scratch. At my simple hobbyist level I haven't experienced a whole lot of tedious repetition across robots, but I definitely got far enough to see it looming on the horizon. My last robot (many years ago) was built around a very compact PC laptop as its brain, which made the project very powerful but also very expensive for its day. Today, I can get that kind of power in an inexpensive Raspberry Pi. Which happens to be one of the platforms supported by the <a href="http://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System</a>. So this is where I'm going to start.</p>
<p>I'm barely into the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials#Beginner_Level">beginner tutorials</a> but I see enough to appreciate what they have, and also to start having questions. I like the fact modules communicate over commodity network transports (TCP or UDP) and the master negotiation procedures are built around XML-RPC. It does add overhead but it's the kind of overhead that allows a great deal of flexibility. But it is also a vulnerable security exposure. I haven't seen anything talking about best practices to deal with rogue nodes on a ROS network but I hope that is coming up soon.</p>
<p>When the tutorial starts talking about writing code to create ROS nodes, it offers an option for the reader: write in C++, or write in Python? The prudent thing for me to do is to stick to C++, a language I know, while I learn ROS. If I go with Python I'll be learning the programming language on top of learning the ROS framework.</p>
<p>Today I'm in a 'chasing shiny objects' kind of mood, so I'll start down the Python path. Whether this turns out to be a wise or foolish choice is yet to be seen. Either way, it'll be documented in upcoming posts!</p>
