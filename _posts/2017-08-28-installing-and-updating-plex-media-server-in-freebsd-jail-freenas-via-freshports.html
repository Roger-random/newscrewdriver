(Either it is hard to find, or that it doesn't exist, it's not user-friendly either way.) The version of Plex media server I received using the default plug-in installation process was several versions out of date and it looked like I was pretty stuck. In order to update, Google found manual instructions that were... well, let's just call them 'nontrivial'.</p>
<p>When I found out Plex media server is also offered as part of the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreeBSD Ports and Packages Collection</a> (tracked via "<a href="https://www.freshports.org/multimedia/plexmediaserver/">FreshPorts</a>") I hoped that might be a much better way to go. I had to manually create the FreeBSD Jail running on my FreeNAS box, which was harder than the built-in plug-in version but was not horrible. Plus, if this goes well, it would be a one-time cost.</p>
<p>After the FreeBSD jail was set up, I opened a shell window into it and typed <code>pkg install plexmediaserver</code> which thankfully took care of downloading and installing all the binaries. The install process also ended with a few paragraphs of instructions on how to configure Plex to automatically start every time that instance of FreeBSD (in my case, the FreeBSD Jail) boots up. Copy-pasting the commands worked as advertised and everything was fairly painless.</p>
<p>I was then able to enjoy my home Plex media server for a few weeks. But there was one unknown: upgrades. I didn't know how upgrades would work until I needed to perform one, so it's just a waiting game for a new version of Plex to be released and see how things propagate. This week, the wait was over!</p>
<p>The first notification was from my home Plex media server. Apparently it checks for updates periodically and notifies me when one is available. After waiting a day or two, the update propagated to FreshPorts. Once that occurred, I opened a shell window into the FreeBSD jail running Plex and issued the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>service plexmediaserver stop </code>to halt the old running Plex.</li>
<li>
<code>pkg update</code> to download the latest database of available packages.</li>
<li>
<code>pkg upgrade</code> to perform updates of any new packages, including Plex.</li>
<li>
<code>service plexmediaserver start</code> to start the new version of Plex.</li>
</ul>
<p>I reconnect to the web interface of Plex running on my FreeNAS box, and I see the latest version up and running. Success!</body></html></p>
