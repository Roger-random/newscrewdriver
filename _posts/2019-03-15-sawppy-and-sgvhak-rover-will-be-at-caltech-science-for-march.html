<p>Shortly after SGVHAK Rover was completed last March, it also made an appearance at California Institute of Technology's <a href="http://scienceformarch.sites.caltech.edu/">Science for March event</a> organized by the Caltech Postdoc Association. The rover was well received and we're <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/259802802">going to do it again</a> for this year's event taking place tomorrow. This event is free and you can <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/caltech-science-for-march-2019-tickets-56488578860">register here</a>.</p>

<p>We were but <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/04/01/sgvhak-rover-at-caltech-science-for-march/">young rover herders at last year's appearance</a>, and there were some durability issues that we think we've addressed. I've taken some of those lessons to heart with my own Sawppy rover, which was only a dream at last year's event but this year will be one of several rovers joining in the festivities.</p>
<p>During our outing at the Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA) Mini Maker Faire, we saw familiar faces from our local friends at Caltech and also nearby Pasadena City College (PCC) and we hope to see them again this year.</p>
<p>The weather forecast is sunny and clear, it should be a good time!</p>
