<p>A quick <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/09/hp-mini-110-1134cl-hardware-specifications/">hardware orientation tour</a> of this retired netbook found that we should be able to run <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation">ROS Kinetic Kame</a> on this computer. Getting a simple ROS Kinetic environment running would be a baseline test to see how it might perform as a robot brain. And for that, we'll have to erase the Windows 7 Starter Edition on this hard drive with Ubuntu 16.04 "Xenial Xerus".</p>
<p>A sticker at the bottom of the machine identified the default operating system as Windows 7 Starter Edition. Since this machine predated Windows 8 mechanism for embedded licenses, we know this hardware would not have <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/01/07/windows-10-can-activate-with-windows-8-hardware-key/">an embedded license for Windows</a> and erasing this drive would mean the loss of a Windows license. I decided a Starter Edition license was no great loss and proceeded to install <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/">Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS, i386 (32-bit CPU) edition</a>.</p>
<p>Installation was successful on this netbook, but it was annoyingly slow to use. Every action required a few seconds, starting from activating the logon screen to every single interaction after that. I don't know if running Windows 7 Starter Edition was any more responsive on this computer, but I wouldn't have wanted to run an end-of-life OS even if it was faster.</p>
<p>What was the bottleneck here? Was it the CPU? Was it the RAM? Was it the hard drive? Or perhaps a combination of the above, like a lack of RAM triggering virtual memory activity that is hampered by a slow hard drive? For diagnosis I appreciated the fact this little netbook had a hard drive activity light, a feature that has been dropped from most modern machine. Judging by the lack of activity on that light, I suspect the problem is a slow CPU and upgrading the drive to a SSD would have limited benefit.</p>
<p>Even with this pessimistic view, I wanted to give it a try. I had a spare SATA SSD already on hand so <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/13/hp-mini-110-1134cl-ssd-upgrade/">it shouldn't take a lot of time to test</a>.</p>
