<p>Once I had <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/22/notes-on-running-esphome-dashboard/">ESPHome set up and running</a>, the software side of creating a small wireless voltage and current sensor node with was super easy. I needed to copy sample code for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://esphome.io/components/i2c.html" target="_blank">I<sup>2</sup>C bus component</a>, then sample code for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://esphome.io/components/sensor/ina219.html" target="_blank">INA219 component</a>, and... that's it. I started getting voltage, current, and power reports into my Home Assistant dashboard. I am impressed.</p>

<p>It was certainly far less work than the hardware side, which took a bit of soldering. I started with the three modules. From left to right: the INA219 DC sensor board, the MP1584EN DC voltage buck converter, and the ESP8266 in a Wemos D1 Mini form factor.</p>

<p>First the D1 Mini received a small jumper wire connecting D0 to RST, this gives me to option to play with deep sleep.</p>

<p>The MP1584EN was adjusted to output 3.3 volts, then its output was wired directly to the D1 Mini's 3V3 pin. A small piece of plastic cut from an expired credit card separated them.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The INA219 board was then wired in a similar manner on the other side of D1 mini, with another piece of plastic separating them. For I<sup>2</sup>C wires I used a white wire for SDA and green wire for SCL lines <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?p=903960" target="_blank">following Adafruit precedence</a>. Vcc connected to the 3.3V output of MP1584EN in parallel with D1 mini, and ground wires across all three boards. The voltage input for MP1584EN was tapped from Vin- pin of the INA219 board. This means the power consumed by ESP8266 would be included in INA219's measurements.</p>

<p>A small segment of transparent heat shrink tube packed them all together into a very compact package.</p>

<p>I like the concept of packing everything tightly but I'm squeamish about my particular execution. Some of the wires were a tiny bit longer than they needed to be, and the shrink tube compressed and contorted them to fit. If I do this again, I should plan out wire my lengths for a proper fit.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, the hardware took far more time than the software, which thanks to ESPHome became a trivial bit of work. I was soon staring at a flood of data, but thankfully ESPHome offers <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/02/24/esphome-sensor-filters-help-manage-flood-of-data/">sensor filters to deal with that</a>, too.</p>
