<p>I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/10/01/adding-noble-specified-hardware-failed-to-enable-ble-discovery/">didn't manage to get Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) running in Node-RED on a Windows PC</a>, so experimentation moved on to other hardware platforms. Specifically the hardware hacking darling Raspberry Pi. I knew it was possible because of the number of projects that already existed, plus <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/raspberrypi" target="_blank">Node-RED has an instruction page dedicated to Raspberry Pi installation</a>. This would be straightforward... except I intentionally made things difficult for myself.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The twist is that my Raspberry Pi 3 readily available for experimentation was most recently set up to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/08/03/update-on-arm64-ros2-on-pi/" target="_blank">check out ROS on <code>arm64</code></a>. Which meant it was running <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubuntu 20 for 64-bit Raspberry Pi</a> instead of the default <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi OS</a>. (Formerly known as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/latest-raspberry-pi-os-update-may-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspbian</a>.) I was confident all the fundamental parts of Node-RED such as flows and network I/O would continue functioning, which makes it a low-power alternative to running Node-RED on a PC. But the other reason to run Node-RED is to interface with devices via Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. I wanted to know how well that would work under <code>arm64</code> Ubuntu.</p>

<p>And I got my answer: it does not work. It appears whatever means Node-RED employed to access Raspberry Pi GPIO is not available on Ubuntu <code>arm64</code> builds. I assume it is possible to install and/or port over the components required for such support, but today's experiment is just to see if it works out of the box and now I know it does not.</p>
