<p>I wanted to see if I can <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/28/esa-iss-tracker-on-hp-stream-7/">employ my unused HP Stream 7 as an International Space Station tracker at home, displaying ESA's HTML application</a>. The software side looks promising, but I ran into problems on the hardware side. Specifically, power management on this little tablet currently seems to be broken.</p>
<p>The first hint something was awry is the battery runtime remaining estimate. It is unrealistically optimistic as shown in the screen image above: 46% battery may run this little tablet for several hours, but there's no way it would last 4 days 4 hours. At first I didn't think it was a big deal. Battery-powered devices that I've dusted off would frequently give wildly inaccurate initial readings on battery. It is common for power management module to require a few charge-discharge cycles to re-calibrate.</p>
<p>In the case of my tablet, a few battery cycles did not help. Battery estimates remained wildly inaccurate after multiple cycles. But I was willing to ignore that estimate, since battery life is not a concern in a project that intends to run tethered to power around the clock. The bigger problem was the tablet's behavior when plugged in.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-21368 aligncenter" src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hp-stream-7-plugged-in-not-charging.jpg" alt="HP Stream 7 plugged in not charging" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>Once power is plugged in, the battery life estimate disappears and <strong>(plugged in)</strong> was added to the description. This is fine, but I had expected to see something about charging the battery and there was nothing. Not "charging", not "2 hours until full", not even the occasionally infuriating "not charging". There is a complete lack of information about charging in any form.</p>
<p>Still I wasn't worried: if the tablet wants to run off plug-in power and not charge the battery, that's fine by me. In fact I am happy to leave the battery at around 50% charge, as that is the healthiest level for long term storage of a lithium chemistry battery. But that's not the case, either: the tablet will run <em>mostly</em> on plug-in power, but still slowly drain the battery until it was near empty, at which time the tablet would power down.</p>
<p>Only after shutting down did this tablet begin to charge its battery. Now I am worried. If I can't run this tablet on plug-in power alone, requiring a battery that can't be charged while it is turned on, that combination would make it impossible to build an around-the-clock ISS tracker display.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do next was to poke around with the hardware of this tablet and <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/04/30/hp-stream-7-battery-disconnect-test/">see if I can run it without the battery</a>. Fortunately, unlikely most modern compact electronics, the HP Stream 7 can be opened up for a look.</p>
