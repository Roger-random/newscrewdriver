<p>I have a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/05/packaging-esp_8_bit-video-code-into-arduino-library/">minimally functional ESP32 Arduino display library</a> that lets sketches use the color composite video signal generator of ESP_8_BIT to send their own graphics to an old-school tube TV. However, all I have as an interface is a pointer into the frame buffer. This is fine when we just need a frame buffer to hand to something like a video game console emulator, but that's a bit too raw to use directly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I need to put a more developer-friendly graphics library on top of this frame buffer, and I have a few precedents in mind. It needs to be at least as functional as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Avamander/arduino-tvout/" target="_blank">existing TVout Arduino library</a>, which only handles monochrome but does offer a minimally functional graphics API. My prime candidate for my purpose is the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adafruit GFX Library</a>. That is the target which contenders must exceed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm willing to have an open mind about this, so I decided to start with the most basic query of "ESP32 graphics library" which <a href="http://www.fabglib.org/">pointed me to FabGL</a>. That homepage loaded up with a list of auto-playing videos that blasted a cacophony of overlapping sound as they all started playing simultaneously. This made a terrible first impression for no technical fault of the API itself.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After I muted the tab and started reading, I saw the feature set wasn't bad. Built specifically for the ESP32, FabGL offers some basic user interface controls, a set of drawing primitives, even a side menu of audio and input device support. On the display side (the reason I'm here) it supports multiple common display driver ICs that usually come attached to a small LCD or OLED screen. In the analog world (also the reason I'm here) it supports color VGA output though not at super high color depths.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But when I started looking for ways to adapt it to some other display mechanism, like mine, I came up empty handed. If there is provision to expose FabGL functionality on a novel new display like ESP_8_BIT color composite video generator, I couldn't find it in the documentation. So I'll cross FabGL off my list for that reason (not just because of those auto-playing videos) and look at something else that <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/05/07/window-shopping-lvgl/">has well-documented ways to work on an external frame buffer</a>.</p>
