<p>Thanks to Black Friday sales, I have upgraded my phone to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Pixel 7</a>. My primary motivation was its camera, because most of the photographs posted to this blog were taken with my cell phone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_5a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pixel 5a</a>) camera. Even though I have a good Canon camera, I've rarely pulled it out because the cell phone photos have been good enough for use here. By upgrading to the Pixel 7, I hope to narrow the gap between the phone camera and a real Canon. So far it has been a great advancement on many fronts. There are other phone camera review sites out there for all the details, but I wanted to point out one trait worse than my Pixel 5a. It is specific to the kind of photos I take for this blog and not usually covered by photography reviews: with close-up shots, the image quality quickly degrades as we move off-axis.</p>

<p>I took this picture of an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview" target="_blank">Adafruit Circuit Playground Express</a> with the Pixel 7 roughly fifteen centimeters (~6 inches) away. This was about as close as the Pixel 7 camera was willing to focus.</p>

<p>The detail captured in the center of the image is amazing!</p>

<p>But as we get to the edges, clarity drops off a cliff. My Pixel 5a camera's quality also dropped off as we moved off-axis, but not this quickly and not this badly.</p>

<p>For comparison, I took another picture with the same parameters. But this time, that GND pad is the center of the image.</p>

<p>Everything is sharp and crisp. We can even see the circuit board texture inside the metal plated hole.</p>

<p>Here are the two examples side by side. I hypothesize this behavior is a consequence of design tradeoffs for a camera lens small enough to fit within a cell phone. This particular usage scenario is not common, so I'm not surprised if it was de-emphasized in favor of other camera improvements. For my purposes I would love to have a macro lens on my phone, but I know I'm in the minority so I'm not holding my breath for that to happen.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I could mitigate this effect by taking the picture from further away. This keeps more of the subject in a narrow angle from the main axis, reducing the off-axis blur. I would sacrifice some detail, but I still expect the quality to be good enough for this blog. And if I need to capture close-up detail, I will have to keep this off-axis blur in mind when I compose the photo. I would love a sharp close-up photo from frame to frame, but I think I can work with this. And everything else about this Pixel 7 camera is better than the Pixel 5a camera, so it's all good!</p>
