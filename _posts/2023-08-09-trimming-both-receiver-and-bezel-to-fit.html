<p>I want to install a cheap wireless CarPlay/Android Auto receiver into my 2004 Mazda RX-8 factory navigation display enclosure, but it was just a little bit too wide. I rather not cut the enclosure so I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/08/peeking-inside-a-wireless-carplay-android-auto-receiver/">took a look inside the receiver</a> to see if I can get things to fit by just cutting the cheap Amazon purchase. While there weren't any electronics on the edges where I wanted to cut, the front face is made of glass instead of clear plastic, and I don't have a good way to cut that. I resigned to the fact I have to cut into the interior trim piece after all.</p>

<p>My tool of choice is the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/16/cutra-wondercutter-s-is-expensive-but-also-really-cool/">Cutra WonderCutter S</a>, which had no problem cutting ABS plastic.</p>

<p>While setting up to start cutting, I took a closer look the soft rubber bumpers that exist to cushion the face as it closed. I thought they were pretty permanent but they were actually really easy to remove after a light tug to stretch and make it thinner.</p>

<p>I couldn't cut the glass face of the receiver. I could probably cut the sheet of plastic bonded to that glass, but it'd be a lot of work for minimal gain. Everything behind them, though, were thinner and easier to cut free.</p>

<p>To fit those trimmed-down sides, I cut slots into the bottom of existing molded support posts. This way I preserve the ability to remount original equipment if I wanted, and also leaves open the option to use those supports to mount the new receiver. With these slots, and with the soft rubber bumpers removed, the receiver can slide into place. (In the orientation of this picture, the receiver slides in from right to left.)</p>

<p>Once the receiver was in place, I had final confirmation there's very little remaining space for my connectors. I ordered right-angle adapters for all connections:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>For sound, <a href="https://amzn.to/44SRXu5">right-angle 3.5mm audio extension cable</a>. (*)</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>For power, <a href="https://amzn.to/3rWIgMR">right-angle USB-C extension cable</a>. (*)</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>For the backup camera, a <a href="https://amzn.to/3QotPej">right-angle 2.5mm TRRS extension cable</a>. (*)</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I needed to wait a few days for them to arrive but that's OK, as it turned out I had <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/10/audio-head-unit-was-damaged-during-removal/">some problems to diagnose</a> before I could reset my old navigation system.</p>
