<p>I've taken apart countless numbers of 3.5" desktop hard drives <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/25/western-digital-wd800-mechanical-bits/">like a Western Digital WD800</a>, but I haven't taken apart many (any?) 2.5" laptop drives. There used to be a significant price premium for laptop components, an extra cost that I didn't need to pay for my own needs. This started changing a few years ago: increasing power efficiency requirements and benefits of miniaturization meant small and power efficient components no longer demand a huge price increase, and nowadays laptops outsell desktops. Also, dropping prices of flash memory solid-state drives meant a lot of laptop-sized 2.5" hard drives got replaced. With terabyte SSDs available for well under a hundred bucks, I can't think of any reason why I'd ever want to use a 250GB laptop sized hard drive again, so I'm taking apart this Toshiba HDD2D90.</p>

<p>On the bottom I see four wires going into the spindle motor, which I now know to be a brushless motor with "Wye" style winding.</p>

<p>I don't see an easy way to tap into motor wires while running, so I'm going to skip the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/23/hard-drive-wd800-motor-control-on-oscilloscope/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oscilloscope examination for this drive</a>.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>

<p>Closest to the motor control contacts is a chip with Texas Instruments logo and text 7CCN5NTA G4 TLS2502.</p>

<p>Chip with largest surface area was set at an angle relative to everything else. I don't recognize the logo offhand, but a brief search with PSC acronym found Taiwan-based <a href="http://www.powerchiptech.com/">Powerchip Semiconductor Corp</a> and a matching logo. I didn't find an exact match for text A2V64S40CTP 747AFD1N but similar model numbers designated memory chips.</p>

<p>Spansion was acquired by Cypress Semiconductor which was itself acquired by Infineon Technologies. After multiple mergers, it was pretty hopeless trying to find details on a FL040A005 74699043. But Spansion's main product line were flash memory, so this is probably a chunk of flash holding configuration, calibration, and drive-specific information such as remapping of bad blocks.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In between the DRAM candidate and flash memory candidate is a large chip with an old Marvell logo and text 8816717-TFJ1 FT15241.2 0747 C0P TW</p>

<p>My failure to find much of any information on the above chips were disappointing, but at this point no longer surprising. I continued onward to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/02/27/toshiba-2-5-250gb-sata-hdd-mechanicals-hdd2d90/">mechanical disassembly</a>.</p>
