<p>I'm quite comfortable poking around inside the tower case of a DIY PC. I've built a few PCs from components, and I've bought a few that came prebuilt by a shop. In my PC experience I've focused on the functional side of things and haven't paid much attention to the aesthetics side. There's a whole segment of the market enchanted with flashy LEDs. As an electronics hobbyist, it had been hard for me to look at those accessories seriously. I know how little addressable RGB LED modules cost in bulk, and it is quite clear those PC accessories were sold at a huge profit margin. I would be more inclined to build my own LED creations like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/tag/glow-flow/" target="_blank">Glow Flow</a> than to pay a premium just for overpriced flashy lights in my PC.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But what if I looked <em>beyond</em> products' MSRP? Since this particular market is about novelty, just like the clothing fashion industry there is a high turnover of products. The huge profit margin entices startups hoping to make it big, and most don't. High product turnover means there are those who upgrade to the latest look. Each of these scenarios can lead to products sold well below MSRP: (1) clearance sales on unsold inventory of "old looks" (2) liquidation sales from bankrupt companies, and (3) secondhand markets (eBay/Craigslist) for those who have upgraded. A bargain hunter can find LED-bedazzled gear well below the price of new equipment, and in extreme cases even lower than price of buying new WS2812 modules directly.</p>

<p>Well, now I'm interested! Not for my PC, but for potential future electronics projects. Which means looking at these products and try to figure out how I can repurpose them. I started by looking at the product pages for a few PC hardware component companies and their advertising spiel for RGB LED accessories.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Corsair uses the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/Categories/Products/CORSAIR-iCUE/c/Cor_Products_iCue_Compatibility" target="_blank">iCUE branding</a> as an umbrella covering aesthetics-based accessories. Some are the addressable LEDs I care about, but not all of them.</li>
<li>Gigabyte uses the name <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gigabyte.com/mb/rgb/Product" target="_blank">RGB Fusion</a>.</li>
<li>Asus calls theirs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.asus.com/campaign/aura/global/" target="_blank">Aura</a>.</li>
<li>MSI calls theirs <a href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/mystic-light-rgb-gaming-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mystic Light</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I hit a gold mine on MSI's Mystic Light site, because <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/mystic-light-rgb-gaming-pc/how-to" target="_blank">their FAQ</a> included an entry "<em>What is Mystic Light Extension</em>" that gave the following description:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Mystic Light Extension is a feature of Mystic Light software which allows user to control colors and effects of partnerâ€™s product such as RGB LED Strips, RGB PC Fans or RGB PC Case via on-board JRGB / JRainbow / JCorsair pin header.

    JRGB (4-Pin / PIN-definition: 12V/G/R/B): The JRGB pin header provides up to 3A (12V) power supply for non-addressable 5050 RGB LED solution showing single color.
    JRAINBOW (3-Pin / PIN-definition: 5V/D/-/G): The JRainbow pin header provides up to 3A (5V) power supply for addressable WS2812 RGB LED (ARGB) solution showing rainbow color.
    JCORSAIR (3-Pin / PIN-definition: 5V/D/G): The JCorsair pin header provides up to 3A (5V) power supply to Mystic Light software compatible CORSAIR devices.</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This tells me products that use the JRGB header are colorful but not individually addressable. Products using JRAINBOW or JCORSAIR are 5V devices that uses a single data pin and no clock. This is a very strong hint these products are made of LEDs made of either WS2812 ("NeoPixel") or alternatives that understand the same control signals. I will <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/07/30/shopping-for-pc-cooling-fans-with-rgb-led/">go look for a bargain and try one out</a>.</p>
