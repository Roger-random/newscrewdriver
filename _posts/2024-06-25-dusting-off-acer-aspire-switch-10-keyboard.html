<p>Getting a <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/24/tiny-cat-galactic-squid-on-mx340-lcd/">tiny version of "Cat &amp; Galactic Squid" running</a> seemed like a good stopping point for my CircuitPython exploration with a Canon MX340 control panel. Now I want to go back and further explore CircuitPython's <code>keypad</code> library. It included a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/key-pad-matrix-scanning-in-circuitpython/keymatrix"><code>KeyMatrix</code> class for scanning large button matrices</a> such as those used on a keyboard, which reminded me of a past project idea: repurposing a laptop keyboard. They are nice and compact, designed for easy integration into tight spaces, but they weren't designed to be easily reused beyond the original laptop. I've disassembled several retired broken laptops and I've wished to turn them into compact USB keyboards. Maybe <code>KeyMatrix</code> can finally make that idea a reality.</p>

<p>Looking over my pile of salvaged components awaiting reuse, the best candidate (it was on top) was the keyboard <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2021/06/28/acer-aspire-switch-10-sw5-012-keyboard/">I extracted from a broken Acer Aspire Switch 10</a>. I liked how this small keyboard felt when I typed on it, and believed it would be good to put back in use.</p>

<p>While I can (and have in the past) soldered wires directly to flexible printed circuit (FPC) metal contacts, life would be much easier if I can use a real FPC connector. I used my handy <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/digikey/DKS-PCB-RULER-12INCH/5767550">Digi-Key PCB ruler</a> to measure a pitch of 0.8mm. Given <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/22/fpc-and-breakout-boards-for-mx340-control-panel/">my recent discovery</a> of vendors selling FPC connector breakout boards, I searched for 0.8mm pitch 26-pin breakout boards. Sadly, that combination was not popular enough to have a breakout board with pre-populated connector. The closest I found was a <a href="https://amzn.to/3XxLgwN">0.8mm pitch breakout PCB with no connector but could accommodate up to 30 pins</a>. (*)</p>

<p>I would have to either buy my own 26-pin connector or try to reuse the one I had. Since I like to salvage and reuse, I'm trying the reuse option first. The circuit board was placed on my <a href="https://amzn.to/3RGKidW">MHP30 mini hot plate</a> (*) and brought up to temperature.</p>

<p>The white plastic latch started to turn brown by the time solder melted, but all plastic components still seemed to be in their proper shape when I lifted this connector free. I think this is good enough for a try. If I fail with this connector, then I'll spend money to buy another.</p>

<p>With the connector freed, and the breakout board ordered, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/06/26/acer-aspire-switch-10-keyboard-wiring/">I explored the wiring involved</a>.</p>
