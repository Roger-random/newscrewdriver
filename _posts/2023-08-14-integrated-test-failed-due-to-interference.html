<p>After <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/13/receiver-mechanical-installation-in-navigation-hood/">devising ways to hold everything together</a>, I performed a quick test and things seemed OK. Then I buttoned everything up, reassembled the navigation hood panel, and installed it on the dashboard. Before I reinstall everything else (center ventilation grille on down) I turned on the car to verify everything still worked.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>It did not.</p>

<p>Upon power-up, the navigation hood actuator opened to unveil the screen, which was good. Then I saw the boot-up sequence, which was also good. But a few seconds later, things started going wrong. The screen started blinking on and off every few seconds, and the system acted as if I'm touching the screen even though I have not. (Phantom touches.) When I did try to use the touchscreen, it would react properly only about half of the time. This is not a usable system.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this project, my top worry has been potential interference from the LCD control board. Even though I'm no longer using the original LCD, I had to keep the control board installed to maintain original actuator functionality. To see if the board was indeed causing problems, I disconnected the ribbon cable from the rear module. Doing so disabled hood actuator functionality. On the upside, the random screen blinks are gone, and the capacitive touchscreen functions correctly again.</p>

<p>My earlier quick test placed those components adjacent to each other, but there's something special about actually tightening up and reassembling interior trim that triggered this system freakout. Unfortunate. Looking on the bright side, if my quick test worked it meant I'm not terribly far from a functional arrangement. If I can devise a way to shield the LCD board from the receiver, I may yet be able to reuse the original LCD control board for its motor control capability. I will note that as a future to-do item, because I wanted to keep what I have as "Minimum Viable Product" for this project. <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/08/15/rx-8-navigation-upgrade-project-phase-one-complete/">Use it as-is for a while</a> to see if I find any other problems.</p>
