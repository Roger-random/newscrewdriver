<p>Encouraged by my earlier success buying somebody's implementation of an IC reference design off Amazon, I went looking for more. The previous project used a MP1584 chip to regulate the variable voltage of a battery to a constant level for a Raspberry Pi 3. Now I want to improve upon the battery side.</p>
<p>The battery pack had three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes#Lithium-ion_batteries_.28rechargeable.29">18650-sized</a> lithium-ion battery cells in series. These cells were salvaged from an old Dell laptop's power pack. Since they were ten years old, there's a bit of a question mark hovering over them. A battery pack that simply wires them in series risks over-charging or over-discharging the weakest cell. This abuse of lithium-ion cells usually ends in a fire.</p>
<p>I searched for a battery management circuit board to help me avoid setting my projects on fire. I settled on <a href="https://amzn.to/2nUHHSC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this item</a> (*) which is built around the <a href="http://datasheet.sii-ic.com/en/battery_protection/S8254A_E.pdf">Seiko Instruments' S-8254A IC</a>. This circuit board will monitor individual cells. If any of the voltage levels exceed safe limits for lithium-ion cells during either charging of discharging, the chip will disconnect the whole pack.</p>
<p>Once everything was connected according to instructions, I have a battery pack that I can use with much higher confidence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using my <a href="http://www.astroflight.com/101n">Astro-Flight power meter</a>, I put this battery pack through a full charge and discharge cycle. Something I was squeamish to do before the battery protection board. Upon completion of the cycle, the power meter counted 1.65 amp-hours. The text printed on the cells say LGDA2E18650, which had a nominal 2.25 amp-hour capacity when new. Ten years old and 73% of nominal capacity is not bad, and perfectly usable for a wide range of future projects.</p>
