<p>I'm looking forward to learning CadQuery and I'm happy to learn <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/26/cadquery-constraints-friend-or-foe/">constraint solver capability exists</a>. It may be experimental, and it may yet prove to be as frustrating as its FreeCAD counterparts, but knowing it exists gives me a goal to learn enough CadQuery to get there. As part of that journey I thought I would take another attempt at getting its default GUI tool CQ-editor up and running.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On my first pass, I followed instructions to install CadQuery components in a Python virtual environment then installed CQ-editor as an add-on within that Python virtual environment. Sadly I only got into an useless state where I could launch CQ-editor but nothing ever showed on screen. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Or is this a bug? I had no diagnostic feedback. Very FreeCAD-like, and not a great start! At least I could get Jupyter working in that Python virtual environment, so I had something.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Re-reading CadQuery installation instructions again, I noticed there was a <a href="https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#adding-a-nicer-gui-via-cq-editor">standalone installer for CQ-editor</a>. So instead of installing CadQuery as a collection of Python libraries then installing CQ-editor as a consumer of those libraries, we have an installer more along the line of standard desktop software installer. Which in this case means installing CQ-editor and pulling in CadQuery as its dependency.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Wary of the possibility that this installer may go sour and collide with what I have running (it is just a "nightly" build and not an official release) I decided to try it on a virtual machine first. I spun up a new VM with <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/04/27/first-impressions-proxmox-ve-vs-truenas-scale/">Proxmox</a> and booted it into a <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">network installer for Debian</a>. For most experiments that is enough, as I can remotely control the machine via a command line using SSH. But CQ-editor is a graphical interface tool and my main machine runs Windows 11 so I wanted to access its graphical interface via Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol.</p>

<p>This is a job <code>xrdp</code>. Multiple tutorials exist on the internet for more details (<a href="https://itslinuxfoss.com/xrdp-server-on-debian-11/">example</a>) but the succinct note for my future self is:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Install the component with <code>sudo apt install xrdp</code>
</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Give <code>xrdp</code> user permission to access SSL resources (to establish RDP connection) with <code>sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert</code>
</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Restart <code>xrdp</code> so it can access its new SSL permissions with <code>sudo systemctl restart xrdp</code>
</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Verify it is back up and running with <code>sudo systemctl status xrdp</code>
</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This procedure allowed me to connect to this fresh virtual machine via "Remote Desktop Connection" application from my Windows machine, and I could follow instructions for CQ-editor standalone installer without any issue. And this time, when I launched CQ-editor, I saw its interface on screen come up and I could use it. Fantastic! I now have that option in addition to the Jupyter interface so I could play with both. I'm happy to have these tools at hand as <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/28/cadquery-concepts-overview/">I dive into CadQuery primer</a>.</p>
