<p>For small software projects like a typical beginner Arduino sketch, we can get away with putting everything in a single *.ino file. This was the way LewanSoul <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2019/05/07/examining-lewansoul-arduino-library/">served up their Arduino sample code for controlling LX-16A serial bus servos</a>. But as a software project grows in size, proper organization of software modules become more important.</p>
<p>While I don't intend to tackle the task of writing a big Arduino sketch, I did want to get an idea of how to write my Arduino code in a way that can be reused in their own installable Arduino library. That's a powerful part of Arduino's software ecosystem, but I don't want to just consume other libraries... I want to get a little practice in so I have the option to write my own libraries later.</p>
<p>I started by reading about <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial">the mechanics of creating an Arduino library</a>. As expected of the world of low power microcontrollers, programming is done in C and a library has, at a minimum, a <code>*.h</code> header file and a <code>*.cpp</code> implementation file. This was all in order, an Arduino-specific twist is the IDE integration with <code>keywords.txt</code>. That I didn't expect. Everything is packed in a ZIP file.</p>
<p>Next I moved on to Arduino's <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/APIStyleGuide">API design style guide</a>. This is less about the mechanical details, and more about how to structure an Arduino API. This passage caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Some of these run counter to professional programming practice. We’re aware of that, but it’s what’s made it possible for so many beginners to get started with Arduino easily.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This might be what caused some of my irritation with Arduino code - design decisions that ran counter to my professional practice, but now I understand there's a well-meaning reason for it.</p>
<p>From there reading moved to the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StyleGuide">Arduino style guide</a> for how to structure tutorials that accompany code, then I went back to see the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/JoyStick">analog joystick tutorial</a> I had referenced earlier, this time as an example of Arduino tutorial style.</body></html></p>
