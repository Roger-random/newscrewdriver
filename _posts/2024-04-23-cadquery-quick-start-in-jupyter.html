<p>After a few unproductive FreeCAD sessions where I spent most of my time <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/04/22/infuriating-freecad-error-messages/">trying to understand uninformative error messages</a>, I decided I need to take a break from banging my head against that particular brick wall and look at something else. When I had performed a brief survey of open-source CAD solutions, I only <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2023/07/20/window-shopping-cadquery/">scratched the surface of CadQuery</a> because I had managed to catch it at an awkward stage. At the time most of Python ecosystem have moved to 3.11 but CadQuery had not done so yet. Most critically, I wanted the Jupyter interface and it would not be possible until the version support lines up between those two pieces of software.</p>

<p>In the time since my survey, this problem has been resolved and I could play with CadQuery in a Jupyter notebook. I tried to get the default GUI CQ-editor running just for the sake of looking it over, but I had no luck running it. I would start the executable, I could see an application process running, but no GUI ever showed up on screen. Shrug. I doubt I would have used it anyway because I like the concept of doing CadQuery in Jupyter.</p>

<p>A big advantage I see in code-based CAD is the ability to add code comments in between operations, describing the high-level intent behind the actual code statements. Commenting individual operations is not practical in GUI-based CAD tools like Onshape or FreeCAD. Furthermore, while I could enter comment text with Python comment syntax in CQ-editor, a Jupyter notebook offers significantly more documentation capabilities. As I understand it, it's literally the difference between plain text and markdown.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html">CadQuery's quick start tutorial</a> was written for a beginner to follow along in CQ-editor, my failure to get CQ-editor running meant I had to convert instructions to Jupyter on the fly. My biggest light bulb moment was realizing I could call <code>display(result)</code> at multiple points in my Jupyter notebook. This gives me a snapshot of the current incomplete state, every time I called <code>display(result)</code>. So anyone reading the notebook (like me, 6 months from now) could visually see how the object evolved into its final form. I like where this is going.</p>
