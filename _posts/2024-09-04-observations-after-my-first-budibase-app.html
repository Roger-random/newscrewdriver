<p>I've converted my personal finance tracking information from a spreadsheet to a database. And while I can input new data with a PostgreSQL command line tool (<code>psql</code>) I'm learning how to build a friendlier interface with Budibase. I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/09/03/budibase-relationship-problems-create/">run into a few problems</a> but since I'm such a beginner it's too early to say if they are Budibase problems or if they're just beginner problems. One thing I can say for sure: Budibase made it extremely easy to get up and running with a table-based interface. So my "minimum viable product" is basically what I had before (table in a spreadsheet) and it's all upside from here.</p>

<p>One thing I've noticed about myself is that I have an easier time taking my idea and figure out the PostgreSQL operations needed to make it happen. I have a much harder time figuring out which Budibase tools exist to solve the same data manipulation problems. As a result I have a nice long list of custom SQL queries registered in my Budibase app, trusting Budibase to display the results in a sensible table which it has always been able to do. I think a big part of this is because I have a better idea what keywords to search for when looking to do something with SQL, reinforced by the fact there's significantly more information on the web about SQL than about Budibase. A smaller part is that I'm still having a hard time understanding certain details in Budibase documentation. For one example: <a href="https://docs.budibase.com/docs/array-helpers">Budibase data binding helpers for array data</a> has two very similar methods: <a href="https://docs.budibase.com/docs/array-helpers#equals-length"><code>equalsLength</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.budibase.com/docs/array-helpers#length-equals"><code>lengthEqual</code></a>. Budibase documentation explains two of them using very similar language and I can't figure out how they are different. Why do they both exist? When should I use one versus the other? Budibase documentation does not say, leaving me frustrated.</p>

<p>I also went poking around for entry point/hooks for external code. I guess custom SQL queries technically count as "external code" but I was looking for a general programming language. Earlier I found that Budibase data binding supported snippets of JavaScript for data operations. I found a fairly similar mechanism available <a href="https://docs.budibase.com/docs/js-scripting">for creating Budibase automation</a>. Both cases are intended for fairly small snippets of code, restricted only to standard JavaScript operators. The only input are Budibase binding syntax and the only output is a <code>return</code> statement. In contrast to this limited API, the deep end is <a href="https://docs.budibase.com/reference/appcreate">a REST API</a>. I didn't find anything in between these two extremes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I appreciate how easy it was to in Budibase to build a table-based interface on top of database tables. It is perfectly suited to help people use a real database if they would have otherwise abused a spreadsheet as a database. If they don't know (or care about) relational database concepts, or SQL query syntax, or writing code, it's a great tool. But I know all of those things and I'm already itching to do more with them outside of Budibase constraints. Such a project would have to wait, though, because <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2024/12/16/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries/">I got distracted by a video game called <em>MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries</em></a>.</p>
