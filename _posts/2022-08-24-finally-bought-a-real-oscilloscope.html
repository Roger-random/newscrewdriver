<p>An oscilloscope has been on my workbench wish list for years. I had been limping along with a degraded <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/01/22/dso-138-oscilloscope-kit-by-jye-tech/" target="_blank">DSO-138 kit</a>, occasionally wishing for something with more channels, or more bandwidth, or just the ability to measure voltage levels accurately. The key word being <em>occasionally</em>. I haven't felt that I would use an oscilloscope enough to justify the expense. But when this year's Amazon Prime Day rolled around, the memory of <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/08/01/exploring-6-wire-connector-of-asiahorse-magic-i-120-v2/">deciphering multi-channel signals</a> was fresh on my mind, and I clicked "Buy" on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3vYLX3K" target="_blank">Siglent Technologies SDS1104X-E Oscilloscope</a>. (*)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I had actually been eyeing a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3QKdPAy" target="_blank">Rigol DS1054z</a>(*), which had become a very popular entry-level oscilloscope for hobbyists. It is sold far and wide <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2145" target="_blank">including my favorite vendor Adafruit</a>, and its popularity meant plenty of online resources. From basic beginner's "Getting Started" guides to hacks for unlocking features. Ah yes, those features. They were a big part of why I hadn't bought the Rigol: it really sours me on a company when they would hold features for ransom even though all of the hardware is already present. Sure, I could visit questionable websites and generate codes to unlock those features without paying for them, but just the idea of buying from a company that would do such a thing turned me off.</p>

<p>While the Siglent oscilloscope did have a few paid upgrade features, they all involved additional hardware not already onboard. This made the concept more palatable for me. For reference, they were:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi capability. The scope comes with an Ethernet port for network connectivity. Wireless comes at extra cost for the software upgrade in addition to the cost of a supported wireless adapter. I prefer wired Ethernet so I did not care.</li>
<li>AWG (arbitrary waveform generator) capability requires extra hardware in the form of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3A2f2w2" target="_blank">Siglent SAG1021I</a>. (~$175 *) So far, my waveform generation needs have been very basic. So basic, in fact, that I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/12/18/lrwave-1-0-complete/" target="_blank">wrote a HTML app</a> to cover my needs. I don't think I'll miss this feature.</li>
<li>MSO (multi-signal oscilloscope) capability requires a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3C8Du1z" target="_blank">Siglent SLA1016</a> (~$330 *) which adds sixteen additional digital channels for logic analysis. Between the four channels already on board the oscilloscope (which already has logic analyzer functionality without paying to unlock as would a Rigol) and eight channels on my Saleae, I think I'll be fine without the MSO add-on.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One thing that made me frown was that the AWG and MSO addons connect by something Siglent called "SBus". Proprietary expansion ports are nothing new, but they chose to use a HDMI connector for the purpose. With a warning that plugging in actual HDMI devices would damage the oscilloscope. Gah! I see the economic advantage of using an existing high bandwidth connector already produced at high volume, but the resulting user experience sucks. Since I don't plan on making any SBus upgrades, I will try my best to ignore that not-HDMI port.</p>

<p>This oscilloscope cost more than a Rigol DS1054z, though it is technically cheaper because many of Rigol's paid add-ons were on the Siglent without extra charge. The Prime Day discount closed the price gap enough for me. Once it arrived, I <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/08/25/notes-on-siglent-sds1104x-e-oscilloscope-users-guide/">dug into the manual</a> eager to learn about my first real oscilloscope.</p>
