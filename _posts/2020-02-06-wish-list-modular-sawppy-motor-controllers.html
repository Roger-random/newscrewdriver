<p>One of the goals for my <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/01/original-goals-for-sawppy-ros-melodic-project/">now-abandoned ROS Melodic Sawppy software project</a> is something I still believe to be interesting. In contrast with the non-rover specific goals I outlined over the past few days, this one is still a rover item: I would like Sawppy motor control to be encapsulated in modules that can be easily swapped so Sawppy siblings are not required to use LX-16A servos.</p>
<p>My SGVHAK rover software had an infantile version of this option, and it was written in extreme time pressure to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/04/17/sgvhak-rover-steering-restored-with-servo-hack/">support our hack of using a RC servo controller to steer the right-front corner</a> during SGVHAK rover's SCaLE debut. In SGVHAK rover software, all supported motor controller code are all loaded, an unnecessary amount of complexity and overhead. It would be nice for a particular rover to bring in just the code it needed.</p>
<p>The HBRC crew up in the SF Bay Area (Marco, Steve, and friends) have swapped out the six drive wheels for something faster while keeping the servos for steering, so a starting point is to have options for different controls for steering and driving. But keeping in mind the original scenario was using a RC servo to hack a single steering corner, we want to make it possible to use heterogeneous motor controllers for each of ten axis of motion.</p>
<p>I need to better understand Rhys code to know if this is something I can contribute back to the Curio ROS Melodic software project. Rhys has stated an intent to bring in <code><a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control">ros_control</a></code> for Curio software stack. Primarily for the reasons of <a href="http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control">better Gazebo simulation</a>, but it would also abstract Sawppy motor control logic: generic velocity controllers for driving wheels and position controllers for steering. And from there, we can have individual implementations responding to those controllers. Is that how it will work? I need to ramp up on Gazebo and <code>ros_control</code> before I can speak knowledgeably about it.</p>
