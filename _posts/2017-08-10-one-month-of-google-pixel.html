<p>When my Nexus 5X was rendered unusable by my negligence at the swimming pool, I needed to order a replacement phone. Since I want to stay on the <a href="https://fi.google.com">Google Fi</a> service, my device options were limited. Fortunately, I had been interested in the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone">Google Pixel</a> as soon as it was released and thought I'd wait for its price to drop or until I couldn't wait any longer. With the death of the Nexus 5X, the latter scenario has come to pass. (And as of this writing, the Pixel prices just dropped as well.)</p>
<p>Some remarks from my first month living with a Google Pixel:</p>
<p><em><strong>Camera</strong></em>: One of the much-touted features upon the launch of the Pixel was its <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/Mobiles/Pixel-smartphone-camera-review-At-the-top">camera</a>. And it is indeed quite excellent! A huge step forward relative to every cell phone I've owned... except for its immediate predecessor. In my usage, the Pixel camera was only a minor improvement from the already-excellent camera of the Nexus 5X.</p>
<p><em><strong>Exterior</strong></em>: Another touted feature is the aluminum body that tries very hard not to be a direct copy of an iPhone. This does not suit my personal taste: I prefer my phone bodies to be plastic which has more give than metal. Every phone I've owned to date are plastic-bodied and their corners all show the times when they've been dropped, bounced back, and only left with a tiny mark. Aluminum does not flex like that. If I should drop this phone, the aluminum will bend and stay bent instead of bouncing back. So this aluminum body phone became my first phone with <a href="https://amzn.to/2oRIqnW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a protective case</a>Â (*). What's the point of fancy aluminum if I have to wrap it in plastic anyway?</p>
<p><em><strong>Pixel Launcher</strong></em>: The Pixel OS is mostly stock Android with a few changes. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher&amp;hl=en">Pixel Launcher</a> is the most visible since that's what the user sees all the time. I appreciate most of the changes but I didn't care for the weather taking up the top row of the home screen and displacing 5 icon positions. Knowing the weather is nice, but it's not worth giving up an entire row of 5 icons I could have placed there.</p>
<p><em><strong>Performance</strong></em>: On paper the Pixel should vastly outperform the 5X. In my daily usage the difference is noticeable but not earth-shattering. Another incremental improvement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Daydream VR</strong></em>: The performance advances are more significant when running Google's new mobile VR effort, <a href="https://vr.google.com/daydream/">Daydream</a>. It is much superior to Google <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/">Cardboard</a> from the first moment I put on the headset and grabbed the remote. But it also comes at significantly higher cost. Is the cost worth it? Not at the moment - the Daydream app ecosystem is still thin, but I'm optimistically looking forward to more.</p>
<p><em><strong>Storage</strong></em>: I had the 16GB edition of Nexus 5X, and over its lifetime it received two major Android releases, each larger than the last. Towards the end it was quite a struggle to stay within 16GB. The smallest Google Pixel starts at 32GB, in my view a tacit admission of Android's weight gain.</p>
<p><em><strong>Summary</strong></em>: If I knew a month ago what I know now, I would have ordered a refurbished 32GB Nexus 5X instead of a new Google Pixel.</p>
