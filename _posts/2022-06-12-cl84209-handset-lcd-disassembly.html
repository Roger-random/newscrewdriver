<!-- wp:paragraph --><html><body></p>
<p>I've <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/11/cl84209-handset-lcd-segment-map/">mapped out the custom segments</a> that occupy the lower half of this LCD, from the handset of an AT&amp;T CL84209 cordless phone system. With that knowledge in hand, I wanted to dig a little more into this subassembly. When I removed it from the handset circuit board, I saw tantalizing hints of identification information that was mostly illegible through distorted plastic.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Four small sheet metal loops stamped in as part of the top metal shield held this assembly together. Once I popped those four loops freed of the tabs molded into the bottom-most piece of plastic, I could lay out all of its layers.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>From left to right (bottom to top) we have:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Glossy injection-molded plastic bottom layer that is also most of the structural support.</li>
<li>Thin matte sheet of plastic.</li>
<li>Thicker (~1mm) clear sheet of plastic acting as conduit to distribute light from the single LED.</li>
<li>Thin frosted sheet of plastic acting as diffuser.</li>
<li>Glass LCD assembly with built-in I<sup>2</sup>C controller somewhere under the black blob.</li>
<li>Rubber surround (glued).</li>
<li>Topmost metal shield.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now the objective of the exercise: a clear view of everything printed at the bottom of this handset LCD. Printed on a sticker is the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>GWMS7728B
09470315313</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Printed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_electronics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC)</a> is:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>7728-FPC-B-A152-4709</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I see the logo of stylized "LCD" on both the FPC and etched into glass.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":30793,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://newscrewdriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/lcd-logo.jpg?w=98" alt="" class="wp-image-30793"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I saw the same logo on the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/04/29/mystery-desk-phone-lcd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">base station LCD</a>. And whereas that module was designated 6334, this one is clearly designated 7728 based on that number being repeated three times: etched into a layer of glass, on the white sticker, and also on the FPC connection.</p>

<p>This is a lot of additional information! Unfortunately, more information doesn't guarantee success. Armed with this additional data, I still failed to find any details on this LCD module. But I'll leave them here as a record hoping that my search skills will improve enough in the future to find something. But for today, I have to concede that I've tried everything I know. Lacking an official reference, I can only <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2022/06/13/pinout-of-lcd-salvaged-from-att-cl84209/">summarize all of my guesses</a> about this device.</p>
