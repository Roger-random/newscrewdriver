<p>After I had completed my first pass at the <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/05/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-first-pass-evaluation/">Toshiba Chromebook 2</a>, I moved on to the third and final machine in this research project made possible by <a href="http://www.nuccinc.org/">NUCC</a>: the HP Mini 110-1134CL. It is an example from "netbook" era, a category of computers launched by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC">Asus Eee PC</a>. Netbooks were an early attempt to build minimalist computers for basic internet activity, years before Chromebooks defined their own product category.</p>
<p>Like Chromebooks, the first netbooks ran a custom operating system that offered a web browser and very few other basic applications. But unlike Chromebooks, netbooks quickly abandoned custom OS and started running a special "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7_editions">Starter Edition</a>" of Windows. Was it due to customer demand? Manufacturer preference? Microsoft offering carrot and stick? I have nothing useful to contribute here.</p>
<p>Like the other two machines, when I received this machine the battery was flat. Nothing happened when I first pushed the power switch. Fortunately it could be charged with the "type I" tip for my Targus universal laptop AC power adapter, same as the Toshiba Chromebook 2 I looked at earlier.</p>
<p>While it was charging I looked over its physical condition. There is a missing "N" key on the keyboard, but nothing else was outwardly wrong. Once the battery was charged, I turned it on to take a quick look at its condition. I saw what I recognized as the Windows 7 boot up sequence, but after some time staring at "Welcome..." I never got to the login screen. It threw up an error of "failed to start" without any error codes I could investigate, and suggested "rerun installation" which I don't particularly care to do as we've long passed the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/?c2=14019">end of life for Windows 7</a>.</p>
<p>That's a problem to be looked at later. For now, I'm glad the machine showed signs of life making it worthwhile to spend some time <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/03/09/hp-mini-110-1134cl-hardware-specifications/">looking over its specifications</a>.</p>
