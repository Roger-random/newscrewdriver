<p>I've been learning Onshape and Fusion 360 as they are two of the cloud-based CAD solutions with a subscription tier that's free for me. They each have their strengths and weaknesses and it's always interesting to compare and contrast between them.</p>
<p>One item they share that I found surprising is that neither of them has built-in capability to add gears into the mechanical design. I've always thought of gears as a critical part of any nontrivial machinery. So I had expected to find a significant section of the CAD package to be devoted to creating various types of gears for different applications, simulating and analyzing their suitability to the task, but there was nothing.</p>
<p>For basic projects, a simple spur gear would suffice. Thankfully, both companies have heard the user requests and made simple spur gear creation available as an add-in created with their own respective scripting mechanism.</p>
<p>Extending Onshape requires learning to write code in their custom language <a href="https://www.onshape.com/featurescript">FeatureScript</a>. A member of the Onshape team used it to create the <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5742c8cde4b06c68b362d748/v/16a222adf3cb9a3b33ed9536/e/c72760543a0d4412e72f6d38">spur gear script</a> and made it available in the public documents library. <del>One downside of this approach is the fact that (1) Onshape users needs to make a copy of a public document before they could use it for their own purposes, and (2) all documents created with the free subscription tier of Onshape are public. These two factors combined means <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents?nodeId=3&amp;resourceType=filter&amp;column=promotedAt&amp;order=desc&amp;viewMode=0&amp;q=FeatureScript%20Spur%20Gear">many, many copies of the spur gear script</a> in the public documents library.</del> Correction: <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/help/index.htm#customfeature.htm">Custom FeatureScript can be added to the toolbar</a> without making a copy. Thanks [FS] for the comment!</p>

<p>Fusion 360 did not declare their own scripting language. They expose their extension API to two languages: C++ for the high-performance native code crowd, and the Python interpreted scripting language for the less performance-focused audience. They used to also support JavaScript, but <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID-9701BBA7-EC0E-4016-A9C8-964AA4838954">as of July 2017</a> they have moved that into maintenance mode due to lack of usage.</p>
<p>The spur gear script is part of the sample script library installed alongside Fusion 360, so I didn't have to find a separate download nor was copying of public document necessary. They presented it in both C++ and Python format. I found the Python version in the "Scripts and Add-ins" menu and clicked "Run".</p>

<p>Onshape and Fusion 360's spur gear scripts present their gear parameters in slightly different formats, but both should suffice for simple projects. If I want to do something more complex, I will have to dive into coding my own extension script.</p>
<p>I've wanted to learn more about what is and isn't possible in an extension script anyway, so... challenge accepted!</p>
