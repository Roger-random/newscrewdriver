<p>After I had my fun <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/25/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-docking-base-internals/">looking inside this retired tablet/laptop convertible</a>, I put it all back together and verified everything still worked. As far as I could tell there's no <em>functional</em> problem with this machine, no deviation from original designed performance. It's even capable of running the latest release of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Why it was retired by its original owner? My personal opinion points to the nature of a tablet/laptop convertible. When this class of devices were introduced alongside Windows 8, they were advertised to be machines that combine the best of both worlds. But Windows 8 failed to deliver its promised revolution in touch-centric tablet computing. So machines that made design compromises instead found themselves saddled with the problems of both worlds.</p>
<p>Even though it offered bigger screen real estate than the standard iPad, it had inferior resolution and responsiveness is sluggish. It is also significantly heavier on account of having all the hardware of a PC inside the case, <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/23/hp-split-x2-13-r010dx-sata-but-not-as-i-know-it/">including the hard drive I failed to replace</a>. For normal web browsing and content consumption, it isn't any better than an iPad. Sure, it can be docked into the base to do things an iPad can't, but that just brings in a different set of problems.</p>
<p>The laptop mode dock had to support the weight of a full PC inside the tablet module, whereas normal laptops only had to support the weight of the screen. This class of hardware became inherently top-heavy and required a lot of design work to keep from toppling over. Up to and including unfortunate additions of counterweights. The hinge and docking mechanism adds parts weight and cost, resulting in a laptop that is bulkier and more expensive than non-convertible counterparts. This machine is nominally a 13" laptop but it is almost double the physical volume and weight of a 13" Macbook Air from the same era.</p>
<p>The computer market of 2020 have some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Book">pretty compelling 2-in-1 machines</a>, built with the advantage of several years of hardware advancement. High resolution screens, flash storage, and power-efficient CPUs that can run on smaller lighter batteries. They incurred a much smaller penalty for the compromises of a convertible design. Technology moved on, and first generation convertibles like this model were left behind.</p>
<p>But even if it is no longer desirable as either a tablet or a laptop, this machine is still capable of running latest generation of software. Including latest releases of Windows 10, Ubuntu, and both ROS 1 and 2. Despite being saddled by the performance of a hybrid hard drive, I'm confident some interesting use for this machine will be possible. I'll set this promising machine aside for now to <a href="https://newscrewdriver.com/2020/02/27/toshiba-chromebook-2-cb35-b3340-cracked-screen/">examine the next unit in line</a>.</p>
