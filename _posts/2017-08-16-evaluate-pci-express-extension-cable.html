<p>Building Luggable PC (Mark I) determined that a direct GPU connection to the motherboard takes up a lot of space. For Mark II, a simple riser card would not fit. That leaves us with using a PCI Express extension cable.</p>
<p>A flexible cable allows significantly more freedom in placement. Given this freedom, I wanted the GPU cooling intake to face the same direction as the CPU fan cooling intake. This is better than a simple riser card, which would result in the two fan intakes facing opposite directions. To flip the GPU (and its intake) around, I'll need a longer cable to take the circuitous S-turn.</p>
<p>One word of caution: most extension cables are <a href="https://amzn.to/2o90idP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold to crypto-currency miners</a> (*), who want the flexibility to pack as many GPUs into one computer as possible. Miners are not concerned with bandwidth and latency over the PCIe bus, but I am!</p>
<p>Hunting in the sea of products aimed at miners, my next task is to determine how much I need to pay for a decent quality cable. Amazon vendors sell cables for anywhere from $7 to $70. Some of the reviews left <a href="https://amzn.to/2nr0RiV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the $7 cable</a> (*) warned of destroyed components, making me jittery about going cheap. This cable has the potential to destroy a multi-hundred dollar GPU, a multi-hundred dollar CPU+Motherboard, or possibly both! I climbed up the Amazon price ladder until I found a $30 unit by "<a href="https://amzn.to/2nfcGJf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EZDIY</a>" (*) with a significant number of reviews, none of which complained about destroyed components.</p>
<p>Then it came time to mount everything. The freedom of placement given by the extension cable also takes away the structural connection to the motherboard. I will need to design my own GPU mounting bracket with zero structural help from the motherboard mount.</p>
<p>The PC interface slot standard, built up over decades tracing back to the old ISA expansion cards, is quite a challenge to deal with. Optimized for mass-production with sheet metal, it is not very friendly to hobbyist 3D printing. But it's a problem solvable with enough creativity in Fusion 360 and multiple test prints on the 3D printer.</p>
<p>Once it was all set up, I tested the configuration of both the extension cable and the 3D-printed custom GPU mount to verify everything works. It was a little jarring to see my GPU sitting on top of the box instead of its usual home inside.</p>
